    F A C U L T Y              The mission of Berkeley Fiction Review has always been to
                               publish a wide variety of styles and voices. In Issue 21, we
    Stephen Booth              feel that we have been successful in achieving this goal. The
                               stories found in this magazine are a diverse collection, rich
                               in the different narrative techniques employed and the wide-
                               ranging subject matter explored. From the experimental dis-
    P U B L I C A T I O N S    course on love in aArs Humanum" to the traditional con-
                               templation of a father-daughter relationship in "Sundays with
    Xavier H e r n a n d e z   Melody," the stories represent an eclectic slice of modern
                               society. We are proud of these pieces and believe that this
                               issue has something to offer for every reader.

    A L U M N I                Thanks to our staff, no manuscript went unread during the
                               selection process. Our empty file cabinet bears testimony to
                               their dedicated efforts. We thank the past and present Ber-
    Grace Fujimoto             keley Fiction Review staff for their invaluable help and in-
    John Rauschenburg          put. The magazine would never have come to fruit without
                               you. We also would like to thank the innumerable 'writers
    Nikki Thompson             who shared with us their creative vision and talent. On a
    Elaine W o n g             different note, we want to pay tribute to one of our contrib-
                               uting authors, Ruthanne Wiley, who unexpectedly passed
                               away. Her story, "Things That Cannot Be," is a piece that
                               is reflective of the solid fiction traditionally found in our
                               magazines. We leave you now to enjoy Issue 21 of Berkeley
                               Fiction Review.

                  alsar was not surprised to spot the crow swoop from his
                  roof with one of Pinkie's discarded pacifiers protruding
                  from its beak. He could no longer set out garbage in the
                  alley behind the house without incident. The previous scav-
engers, a pack of emaciated German shepherds, were bad enough, but the
birds ripped plastic bags to shreds and scattered refuse for blocks. Lyra
had just last night thrown out some of the baby's now useless equipment,
and this crow must have snatched up the mottled pacifier, shot over the
house and found itself sinking fast. Cushioned on Balsar's lap as they
rocked on the front porch swing, Pinkie stared intently at the crow's
booty with dim, angry recognition. Balsar lamented that his daughter's
nickname rhymed with binkie, but he had called her Pinkie since the day
she was born—to the dismay of everyone—and would not stop now be-
cause of unfortunate poetry. She started to sass the crow with an angry
ga} ga, ga, but Balsar stroked her back and whispered "It's okay" until she
lost interest. "It's okay" always worked.
     At nine months it had become her habit to grasp a loose segment of
skin on Balsar's neck with the thumb and index fingers of her right hand.
She would pinch gently for half an hour or so as they sat watching pass-
ing cars and blue jays and the occasional airplane. They liked twilight
best, especially during full moons, which Balsar always took as an omen.
There sat father and daughter, separated by practically half a century,
Balsar's neck tweaked by minuscule fingers as the crow labored to stay
aloft, weighed down by an infant's binkie. This is the kind of life I now
lead, Balsar thought. Even the tree in his front yard, which he gazed upon
with fond sadness, made worrisome structural noises because chipmunks

That was one of his tricks. He'd wear the necktie with the palm trees on

not to laugh, but Margaret never thought it was funny. He'd hide behind
doors or in closets. When Margaret would walk into the room he'd jump
out and grab her by the shoulders. He did it so often that it never fright-
ened her. He could make his thumbs disappear. He'd be cutting wood in
the back yard, and then he'd scream and run into the house and Margaret's
sisters and her mother, too, would gather round to see if he was all right.
Then he'd holler and hold up his hand with his palm away from them
and make it look like he'd chopped off his thumb. He did the same tricks
over and over, always the same. The others seemed taken in every time,
Margaret thought, every time, but not her. They'd laugh and say "Oh

I usually used.                                                                     For a couple minutes we sat and listened to the water drip from the

     Keith rolled away from the wall, and I unbuttoned his shirt. Two
scars cut across his chest, one through the center of each nipple. His
flesh sank inward at each slice. His nipples looked like circles with
the middles taken out. I told him it didn't bother me, that his chest
wasn't ugly.
     "Too hot?" The water bit my wrist as I lathered up the sponge.
     "Perfect," she said. "Now turn it off or we'll overflow."
     I began to rub the soap gingerly onto her arms, not wanting to scratch
her.
     "Harder," she said, her hair dragging the water.
     I scrubbed harder, buffing her arms to a bright red.
     "Do you have sex with your boyfriend?" she asked, her voice muffled
and wet.
     I looked at Ginny's matching panties and bra folded neatly on the
toilet and thought of Keith. "I know what it's like to have breasts," he
said once while standing in the shower. His nipples buckled over, col-
lapsed under their own skin. "You think I'm ugly," he said. I took off my
own clothes and hugged him under the water. "No, I don't."
     Ginny twisted her head and looked me in the eye. "Do you have sex
with your boyfriend?"
     I scrubbed at the bottom of her foot and whispered, "Yes."

                         Airport when he spotted her through the wall-sized win-
                         dow. Dressed in the somber seal-gray coat he had given
                         her for Christmas, it was only the crimson in the scarf at
         her throat that caught his eye. With great effort, he beat back his initial
         impulse to smile as foolishly as a gangly adolescent. The deep lines of a
         familiar frown settled in place.
              They had decided before he left for Nice five days ago that it was silly
         for her to meet his plane. He outlined the reasons against it; she nodded
         her acceptance. But here she was after all. She did look lovely standing
         there amidst the stolid Dutch pea-soupers, each of them outfitted in bulky
         winter dress, starkly contrasting with Anna's elegance. Almost involun-
         tarily, his hand rose in a greeting. The intricate knot in her scarf was very
         European, he noticed approvingly. She placed one gloved hand up to the
         window in response and smiled. "The delicacy of his wife's movement
         encapsulated everything he loved about her, and in that instant, everyone
         else waiting at the glass faded to a mere background.
              Moments later, he pulled his bags off the carousel, walking quickly
         through the "Nothing to Declare" gate to greet her. She turned up her
         face for his kiss and they bumped noses. He wondered whether other
         married couples missed each other's lips as frequently as they did.
              "I thought we decided you were going to wait at home." A half-smile
         took some of the sting out of his words.
+\            "When I woke up to find it sunny, I couldn't resist coming. Look
         Duncan, nothing's gone wrong despite your eternal fussing." She took
         his arm affectionately. "Did you miss me at all?"

added to the impressive weight and magnitude of his death, until nothing
else mattered, as if time had stopped and events in the village had come to
a standstill, awaiting the resolution of Alfredo's imminent death.
     Quebrado, as it was called, lay neither here nor there—at the
bottom of a secluded rift, between the town of Santa Luzia and Santo
Antonio, on the island of Pico, in the Azores. It was a forgotten place,
too small to be remembered by anyone who had stumbled upon it.
The village had been abandoned long ago after a severe earthquake
destroyed many of the buildings. At that time, most people simply
moved further up the mountain and built a new village, leaving the
ruins of the old one behind. Some wished to remain in their familiar
homes, where their families had always lived. So these few determined
souls rebuilt what they could and remained in Quebrado, cut off from
all the other towns and villages. It was the kind of place one could
only find by accident, but it happened so rarely, that the villagers
thought of themselves and Quebrado do Caminho as the entire world.
     Every time Alfredo walked into the cafes, his neighbors rushed to
buy him drinks as they would for any good friend who, in a day or two,

behind her glasses. Her face quivers like a bowl of pudding.

     paper napkin. She slides out of the booth, ignoring Ed's hand, and starts
     across the room. Ed shoves the hand in his pocket. As he follows behind
     her, he feels a knot of panic growing tight inside his stomach. He knows
     Linda must be watching from the counter—what he wouldn't give right
     now for a beer to drink, a dart to toss, a cigarette to stamp out under his
     boot toe—but he doesn't look her way. He keeps his eyes straight ahead,
     on Melody.
           The hula instructor is a waitress with blond ringlets and saddle shoes.
     She beams as she hands Ed and Melody their pink hoops. Feeling ridicu-
     lous, Ed steps into his, holding the candy-striped plastic tubing against
     the hard denim waist of his jeans.
           "Okay, everybody!" the saddle-shoe girl shouts. "Let's huuuula!"
           The music surges. All at once, the crowd is alive with noise and color
     and motion. Ed throws his hoop, hard, to the right, but it immediately
     spirals down, down, down his hips and thighs and calves—in wide, lei-
     surely loops, as if taunting him by taking its time about it—til it shivers to
     a stop on the floor. He grabs the hoop, feeling like he's been caught with
     his pants around his ankles. This time, he throws it harder, whipping it
     around his waist. But the extra force only makes the hoop coil to the
     floor that much faster.
           Ed looks at Melody, trying to catch her eye. She sees him and yells
     something over the music.
           "What?" Ed yells back.
           "Move your hips!"
           Ed grips the sides of the hoop. He gives it another throw. This time,
     he starts rotating his hips in circles, like the other hula-hoopers seem to
     be doing. But all at once, his body feels horribly out of control. His smooth,
     blue-jeaned hips feel like cannons misfiring, his copper-seamed legs like
     sticks of jelly. His arms are out stiff at his sides, like a plane ready for
     take-off. The hoop, however, manages to stay up a little longer before
     finding its way to the floor. Ed picks it up and tries again, and again, and
     again, tossing the hoop and swinging his hips. His elbows flail, knees
     buck. Wranglers lose all their cool. But he's starting to get the hang of it,
     a little.
           Through the commotion, Ed watches his daughter. Melody, he real-
     izes, hula hoops like a pro. She tilts her hips in perfect circles, guides the
     hoop as smooth as butter. Her arms are raised, bent at the elbows, sus-
     pended like a dancer's in mid-air. Her face is pink, biting down on her
     bottom lip as she concentrates. Her eyes are closed. She sways, she swings,
     she rocks and rolls, like she's made of music.
