           The willingness to write is not enough. This sounds simple,

       to be good, but most of all, you have to write—a lot.

woven and directed words, words that could steer a class straight
to the heart of the problem. But all around us, I recognized
the salty echoes of travelers who ignored the heart of the problem.
I leaned forward and touched the professor's hand, hoping
perhaps we could walk through the vast space that separated
us from them. But the professor's hands were knuckle-white
tight, ice-blue and frozen to the. line of her words. She hur-
ried away, steel, wire-thin fear tightening around a small patch
of apple green; I ran looking for hands I had passed in the
dark. Out of breath, I stopped and leaned against the base of
the Bell Tower. Biting into the skin of my hands, the concrete
smelled like a gravel road. A group of skater punks glided by.
They smelled like a teenage boy's room; secrecy, dried semen,
spit. Among them was one scrawny young woman, her laces
dangling dangerously loose. She smelled Jike Sally Dansworth.
Sally Dansworth, the girl who had lived in the run-down house
up the block. The girl whose mother never made her shower.
I would masturbate with her behind the back of my garage.
She never spoke and never looked in my eyes. When she had
threatened to tell, I had pulled out Polaroids surreptitiously
taken while she played with herself. I had considered the m
insurance.
     I stumbled away from the University, past Goldensteins—
I hadn't shown up for work or bothered to call in for 3 days—
and stopped on the bridge overlooking the squat Amtrak sta-
tion and a broad ribbon of tracks. I pulled myself up and sat
on the narrow ledge and waited there, letting the breeze that
carried the smell of apple blossoms from all directions sway
me back and forth. I considered (1) buying a lavender planta-
tion, (2) living in a very clean cave, (3) joining a monastery,
or, (4) perhaps pulling a perverted Van Gogh. I realized I wanted
a cigarette, that I needed the feel of the smoke winding down
my throat, filling my lungs. Occasionally my fingers, like a
kiss, brushed against my lips., Far off I could see a train travel-
ing away, a brillet into the heart of the horizon.

      someone knocks on the door.

      Is someone dying in there? an annoyed female voice yells. I
      open the door abruptly, wearing my own face again. No.

      T h e face I see in my head is more like my mother's face. It's
      as if I'm constantly waiting for the wrinkles, for the wisdom of
      age, constantly missing what fills the present m o m e n t , like
      the feeling of my feet on the tile floor.

      Leaving so early? Nora asks. She's standing by the door with a
      drink, monitoring guests as they come and go. W h a t she means
      is, Leaving alone? Yes.

      Back at h o m e , there is still time to enjoy the night. It's early
      and the sky is light because of the clouds, and it's warm enough
      to sit on the porch wearing only my nightgown.

      No. I don't want to wait for the wrinkles, for time, for living. I
      know that when I really do see the gray hairs and the lines
      around my eyes, the face in my head will be a young o n e , the
      one I have now but don't see.

     She took her fingernail away from her teeth. "Jeanne. Is
she here?"
     "Jeanne? You know her?" Secrets. If I had known about
this I may never have given her the fifteen-hundred. I had
sold to this woman once, maybe six months earlier, b ut it just
tapered off and I never thought about it again.
     "She's not around," I told her. "Do you need something?"
     "Yes."
     I didn't like the options it presented. I sighed and leaned

head. "I can't help you." I shrugged. "I'm sorry about your
boy."
     I walked to the end of the landing, shuffling down the
emergency stairs and into the parking lot. I never looked back,
and never looked up from the seat of my car to see her staring
down at me. She would go to the police, then, and p u t the
blame on m e for her rodent kid, and I knew it. It didn't even
matter if I stuck around, because they had m e dead to rights.
     I shoved the bag back u n d e r the seat and drove south, into

and those moments I'd lie awake and actually wonder why I

    He took the Park Avenue off-ramp, which would lead them
home. He was sweaty, tired and almost out of breath. He was
at a loss for words.

    Soon Peru became something he did not talk about. But
what happened in Chavin de Huantar stayed with Elliot. Be-
fore his classes began at the college, he went to the bank and
took three thousand dollars from his account to pay for a treasurer's
check. Yes, the assistant manager said, they could arrange to
send it from the main office in San Francisco and it would
not have his name on it. They Would address it as Elliot indi-
cated, to Pilar Robello in Chavin de Huantar.
    Elliot knew there was some chance the money would not
get to Pilar and less chance that it would make a difference.
Probably Pilar wouldn't know what to do with it. How could
she use it to make something of herself, to become what she
might? She could go somewhere, and perhaps be worse off
than in Chavin, in the sierra where people were at least more
honest.
    When he returned home from the bank he lay down on
his bed. He thought again of Manuella a n d why he hadn't
sent the money to her. It might ease her days a little. But there*
in Chavin de Huantar, people like Manuella were too old to
change. Most of her life was over. She rented rooms in her
house, embroidered cheap blouses, went to church. She would
never be what she once might have been. For her, parents
and uncles died, husbands left. He, Elliot, was none of these.

     I brought the catfish in slowly, let her wear herself down,
the way my father had taught me. She was a nice one, close to
eight pounds at my best guess. When I had her on the bank I
held her still against the black dirt of the riverbank, which
clung in patches to her sticky smooth skin. Her mouth opened
and closed, opened and closed. Her tiny eyes rolled upwards.
I squeezed the trigger and felt her body jerk once, then lie
still under my hand. The bullet left a clean hole through the
forehead and out through the lower jaw; I ran my father's green
rope stringer through.
     I let the fish lie on the ground. My ears rang. The gun was
warm in my hand. I stepped back one step and tossed it up
into the air above the river, and it turned end over end and
came down to break the surface softly, with hardly a splash,
sending circles around circles, rippling out towards the banks.
