     She shoved the gumball in her purse and it landed on top of old
tissue, three dimes and a penny.

     The old fisherman went down to the port. As he neared the sea,
familiar locations and faces opened the doors of the world to him. The
past filled up again with the reassuring ballast of memories, bitter or
joyous, but the singular and unchangeable matter of his life, impel-

the teachings of the sea, its wiles, its sudden furies, its equally unex-
pected and exhausting calms. He stepped onto his boat and set to work
repairing and adjusting its machinery. The contact with the tools, the
purring of the motors, the ocean wind sweeping the smooth wood of
the roof drew him deeper into his affairs, dissipating the overpowering
gravity that the enraptured presence of the Maestro had exerted on the        T h i s     Is   t o        Notify      Y o u    T h a t        t h e

     Now, if her sense of direction is sharper, her grasp of geography
stronger, it is because of him, his dotted existence across continents,
the world. His broken path like pins on a map, planning strategies, the
possibilities of place and time. She imagines herself spinning wildly
through an empty parking lot, eyes closed, arms stretched into a wing-
span, gravel scattering, her balance a practice in perfection until she
can sense him, locate him like an ache on the axis of her body, its
proximities. In the space of a moment her body will form a faultless
halt of motion before him, toe to toe, faces less than inches, their sepa-
rate breaths forming a single breath. She finds his face in crowded
pictures of rowdy squadrons, his voice in noisy poolhalls, his letters
among stacks and piles arranged on the post office floor. He writes: I
smashed things up terrifically today darling—a train nearly a mile long
and full of Italians. I hit every mark like a star. To her there is no longer
an atlas that can be trusted, no longer concerns of north, south, longi-
tude, miles. Now there is only vicinities of him, shades of nearness, of
distance. A measurement of time and space between their separate
skins. Nothing else occurs to her. Years of geography lessons erased.

pathetic apartment filled with clippings and posters of Jan Palach and the

gether with a rubber band and then put it in the envelope, so I can burn it.
So I can set this last little piece of you onfiretoo, and watch the ashes fall
slowly into my trash can, and disappear. Ashes to ashes. That's what I wanted
to tell you. You deserve that. I should know. And one more thing.
