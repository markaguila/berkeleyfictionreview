M            Y Mama and Papa lived in San Juan, in the Sacramento Valley, a
             dozen miles down the road from the state capitol. They were in
             halcyon retirement now, drawing state pensions, floating through
the most placid passage of their lives. They lived in a four-room redwood cot-
tage, with a capacious fig tree shading the backyard. A dozen hens clucked in
the chicken yard, loft fowl, glutted by fallen figs and luscious Tokays from
vines menacing the back fence. These hens deboucjhed massive eggs whose
warmth Mama loved against her palms in ironic nostalgia, for there was oace
a time in the life of this mother when children outnumbered the eggs.
      On a barrel under the fig tree slept Papa's four cats, glistening Egyptian
deities, sleek from beef hearts, calves' brains and milk. These four cats had
replaced four children who had grown up to leave the Valley and marry and
acquire enfeebled eyes and partial dentures because in that earlier time work
was scarce and Papa never earned enough to feed his children regularly on
beef hearts, calves' brains and milk.
      They lived in serene loneliness, my Papa and Mama, reading the Sacra-

      A weekday, the park was nearly empty. Up here, everybody worked.
And those who didn't wouldn't go to the park. Any place but. They would
wait for the weekends, when everybody was there. They needed it full, so
they could complain. Get ready for Monday. Then more complaining. The
story of their lives.

So they'd decided to go to New York, New York City. For maybe a month.

He wanted to see what he'd do. He wanted to see if he'd do anything*at all.
So he started crying. Right there in front of me and Mom he started crying. I

T         hey did not know it but they were travelling within the borders of
          convention. It was everything off-road that was beyond Time and
          uncertain as the Second Coming. So much land and sky and, my
God, so many stars. Under the high July sun, while gazing across the vast,
rolling landscape that approaches the Oquirre Mountains, one can almost be-
lieve the outrageous claims of divine license our leaders have made iii their
deluded efforts to shape this world. But when the sun bets on the wrong hori-
zon and evening descendsln the east, the edges of the road and the contours,
of the dream dissolve. The Eternal King of Uncertainty usurps the American
crown.
      Even the magician felt uneasy in the deep solitude of the dark Utah
night. It was all he could do to keep the car moving straight, as the musician
repeatedly re-adjusted the steering wheel from the passenger seat And these
were men accustomed to the plasticity of reality and time. Finally they too
were forced to seek shelter under the roof of convention at a super-sterile sup-
er-8 motel.
          The magician went straight to bed. The musician remained awake, prac-
    ticing his magic. For the two men had taken each other on as students. And
    while a shiny new quarter rolled over and over the knuckles of hisrighthand
    the musician stared out the window thinking only of rolling rhythms. But then
    hills and visions . . .
        . Slowly, unknowingly, he drifted out of the window, landing softly on
    his bare feet in the cool soil. Along the ridge of a hill, not too far away, he
    could see a light shimmering smoothly. He ran to it with increasing speed,
    bearing the pain in his feet from the stones and twigs on the dry ground. He
    ran until he reached the foot of the hill and only then realized how steep it
    was and that skeletal bushes offered fierce resistance. He thought of returning
    for his sneakers but feared the light would disappear before he could come
    back. So he attacked the slope violently, digging in with his toes and finger-
    nails for balance. His face becarhe damp with sweat but this only caused the
    light to shimmer more brilliantiy in eyes that had become wet with longing.
    He felt his lungs burning for more as he clutched and grasped at weeds with
    roots which did not hold. He felt his will weaken as doubt crept into his heart.
    But this he quickly dismissed. And when his breath had finally been spent,
    when his muscles were numb from the aching strain, he found himself mirac-
    ulously on top of the hill. Looking back, he noticed that the slope was again
    hidden in darkness.
          He turned quickly, gasping, to look down the other side of the hill. At
    the bottom there was a small wooden building, a bar, with two white pick-up
    trucks and an old Mercury Cougar parked outside. He could hear country mu-
    sic seeping through the open door and the open windows up into the night
    like srrioke curling up out of a chimney. The pink neon sign on'top of the
    sharp roof shouted 'Sarah's Oasis' into the darkness. And across the dusty
    road theTe was a gas station with its own neon sigh that was blue and read
     'Gas.' The musician sat down and listened to the music riding softly on the
    evening breeze. Johnny Gash singing "Peace In The Valley." He liked Johnny
    Cash. When all of a sudden the song ended in the middle. Someone had
    pulled the plug on the jukebox, on Johnny Cash. People soon emerged from
    the dark doorway. Three men and two women stumbling and singing in the
    dusty road. And then they were gone and the engines of their horses could
    barely be heard. All that remained were the two neon signs dancing under the
1   blackest blanket in the world, daring to exist in the vast nothingness for all to
    see and...
           It was late. One of the drunken women had even said so. And then
    someone pulled the plug on 'Sarah's Oasis' and the 'Gas' man on top of the
    hill got down on his knees, folded up, and prayed for annihilation.

         A        lgeciras to Techuan
        I thought of myself as Alexander
        Home behind, but in me still—
    |    'The strange eyes, Hashish, the sweet mint tea.'

        And there,
        Sand upon city, double exposure
        Of sun upon window pane
        My conceit withered, and the sand told me:

        If Alexander had not died
        There in the East,
        He might have taken this train
        Weariness of arm-rest, battling knees
        And arriving,
        The wonder of the morning cry
        Might have silenced his step
        And the sea
        The whiteness of sand-shine
        The desert like wise old death on his tongue
        Chaos of the Medina reforming his memory
        And with sun disordered eyes
        An ocean stare into the west
        The pale, whispering end to his flight from defeat

        He might have chosen to leave his army
        Leave his art
        Leave his soul in Macedon
        And stay here

        Wind blew dust into the train
        And Peter laughed when I got mad

        T     ODAY in Ireland there a lot of good
              writers, but there aren't any, what I
              would call, great writers like the poet
        Yeats . . . but then again if you get one of
        them in a century you are doing pretty well.

           EAMUS HEANEY, perhaps the greatest Irish poet since Yeats, talks
           about Irish Literature, America, Ronald Reagan, Wilfred Owen and
    s      the role of the poet in society today.

           "America has become part of the routine of my life. Curiosity was the
    first thing that attracted me there. My first real visit to America was in 1970-
    71 when I taught in the University of Cahfornia, Berkeley, for a year and at
    that time the West Coast was a kind of magnetic, glamorous area. Protest,
    flower-power and so on. And I must say I found the year there very enhanc-

       RENDAN KENNELLY is a Dublin-based poet who has published nu-
        merous books of poetry since the 1960's. He is the editor of The Pen-
        guin Book of Irish Verse and his most recent work Cromwell was
adapted for the stage in Dublin. He holds the position of Professor of Modern
Poetry at Trinity College, Dublin.

     You have written some novels and some plays, yet you are primarily re-
garded as a poet. Are you more comfortable with verse or prose?

   Brendan Kennelly: I would say my natural instincts take me towards
verse . . . if I get an image, or Q phrase, Or even a bit of a phrase, I keep it
there and I let it grow in the quietness of my mind. I like [this] process of
growth, maturation .-.. whatever you call it. I've always liked working with
images rather than [with] ideas.

     You have said that "Poetry is the art of permanent beginning and the

 T       he first dream had the temper of anger.
Drumhead executions in rainy outposts,
Fecula of blood on clothes and hair,
Thrombosis of rivers flashing danger
In low fields, enemy ships on the coast,
A wickerwork of conspiracy laid bare.

It happened over and over. No graceful lady
Came whispering out of starlight,
Nor did the verdigris of old sorrows
Dull the gUtter of migrating courts
Of gold and honour bright.
Nor were there promises of tomorrows.

For the second dream, for the hundreth time,
I have to wait and wait. The flowers come on cue,
The newspapers bear a date, the valleys hum
With traffic. Some still expect a sign,
Some rethink the crisis through,
All quiver within the membrane of a drum.

That can be done is done. Far apart
From Milton's devils is the present crew
Of zombie soldiers and their spies,
Supergrasses in whose hiss
We hear the snake and sense the mist
Rise in dreams that crowd the new
Awaking with their demobbed cries.

In the old ground of apocalypse
I saw a broken church near where
Two lines of trees came to eclipse
The summer light. Beside the stair
A grey crow from an old estate
Gripped on the book of Common Prayer,
A rope of mice hung on a strip

I     RELAND'S youngest and most accomplished filmmaker, Neil Jordan
      lives in an old Victorian house on the seafront of Dublin Bay, alongside
      the house where James Joyce spent his earliest years. Neil Jordan is
 known for his cinematic achievements, he has written and directedfour films:
Arigel (1982), Company of Wolves (1984) and last year's hitMona Lisa, and
an us yet unnamed film soon to be released. He was born in 1950, in County
Sligo] and he attended Belgrove Primary (where one of his teachers was the
Irish novelist John McGahern). At University College, Dublin he read Eng-
lish and History and after failing to be accepted into film school he began a
brief unhappy teaching career at a secondary school. It was during this peri-
od that Jordan earnestly began to write fiction. His first work, an experimen-
tal collection of short stories, Night in Tunisia, won the Guardian Award for
Fiction in 1979. The book was widely recognized asa major breakthrough in
Irish fiction because the stories were entirely disconnected from the Irish
landscape, a theme sdfamiliar in the Works of major Irish short story writers
like Joyce, O'Connor andLavin.

     My short stories don't tell little anecdotes — they were a reaction against the     — placenames, familiar things and the tapestry of literature. I myself find
     homeliness of that particular short story form."                                    [this style of Irish literature] hard to understand, I prefer to see writing that is

        After the success of Night in Tunisia, Jordon published two experimental
     novels: The Past and The Dream of a Beast.                                               Now in making films, J or dan found the directness of expression he was

        bluish colour of that smoothed glass one finds at the water's edge and the
        stem of the cup was twisted like a pair of hands. Then we walked back
I       through the arboured tunnel. Her heels clicked once more against the path.
        She told me that the sides of her legs were wet. She rested her hand on the
        crook of my arm. Behind us tiny animals followed, unseen, only present by
        the noises they made, small whisperings and rustlings as if to celebrate the
        hour that had passed. We agreed to visit the reptile parlour, then to go for the
        time on our separate ways.
               Even as we walked through the shattered awning, I was made aware of
        further changes, by the minute. The skins of dead reptiles hung off the vines
        and as we walked beneath we set them swinging, collapsing the remaining
        panes into shivers of crystal. How wise of that genus, I remarked to her, to
        cast off a surface with each new season. She rubbed her nail up and down my
        forearm and told me about her childhood.
               I listened as she talked about books, how an unlettered farm girl would
        remove them from a large tea chest beneath her father's workbench and
        phrase to herself the long words, few of which she understood. They seemed
         a secret knowledge to her and when she came to work in galleries, her sur-
        prise at the fact that others shared it was only matched by their surprise at the
        freshness her childhood knowledge had retained. Several times I tried to an-
         swer but found my voice retreating once more to the deep cavern of my
        throat. As the words went, then panic came that the essence of the hour we
        had spent was vanishing, shedding itself in turn. She turned to me suddenly,
         as if noticing this, on instinct. It is time to go, she said.
               Before leaving she wrapped me carefully once more. We left by differ-
         ent entrances. I walked back down the long avenue and knew that each
         change that happened was reflected in the bowl-like essence that lay, I some-
        how knew, near the pivot between legs and torso. The avenue was empty of
        people, the shadows slept at the feet of trees, long and somehow full of ease.
        My feet moved over the grass, faster and then faster. I felt abandoned beneath
        those trees and dared to move out into the open fields. I saw a mark on my
w       wrist and made out a number, in statuesque blue ink, barely smudged. She
        had written it there. Everything would be for the best, I felt, haying no knowl-
        edge of what awaited me.

                     blin for the first time, in June 1987, he read to an attentive house
                     from the stage of the Gate Theatre. The stage was set up as Pro-
        fessor Higgins' study in Pygmalion, so that Heaney was surrounded by books
        and comfortable-looking Edwardian furnishings, but also by charts and mod-
        els of the human vocal system. It was a graphic reminder of how much this
        poet has always respected and relished the integrity of words, of how lovingly
        he has gathered and used — or re-used — the language of the tribe, and of
        how in his poems words have their shape, their resonance, their weight
        Shaw's play itself provided an acute and ironic subtext. Pygmalion is an Irish-
        man's play about the English language. It is at once a celebration of the lan-
        guage and a reproach to the English, who have wasted and neglected their
        most valuable possession, their precious heritage. They must relearn their lan-
        guage with teachers from Synge Street, of Lower Drumcondra — where, Ste-
        phen Dedalus tells us, they speak the best English.
              Heaney's poetry has always carried on that work, hefting each word and
setting it in itsrightplace, making it resonate more vibrantly in the ear. "The    a new cartography and in it locates many goodly states and kingdoms, each
