                                                  door on the tottling Janet's head. Since that day she has been a
                                                  fairly eerie little girl. But that's not the interesting part either.
                                                  The interesting part is that she killed her father.

                                                   I also made love to her brother. I too. When we were nine years
                                                  old I held his penis in my hand, a tiny thing, hard with innocent
                                                  ardor. I squeezed it experimentally. Nothing happened.

     Tourists in sun hats, in rows, fringe her breasts, sink into the dark
     nipples, trip over the mole that marks the valley of her ex-

     lands, tounges of grass six feet long, twisting, pacing in the warm

     course through deep veins and thick, blue estuaries. Her arms,

                                           The five-wheeled pedal cab Father summoned was outside. He
                                           spread a cotton blanket on the aluminum seat for Grandma to lie
                                           down there; then he went back inside the hut to fetch her. He
                                           gripped her right arm while she walked, half a step at a time: she
                                           jerked her right heel forward and then dragged her left foot after:
                                           each jerk of the heel carried her half a step, the drag of the foot
                                           the other half, the slippers flapped. She couldn't quite step over
                                           the gutter. But slowly, ever so slowly she lifted her right leg, or
                                           rather, her right leg lifted: It reached across the gutter, the slipper
                                           dangling offher sole; then with a jolt, she tilted forward and
                                           groped the side of the pedal cab, Father's hands pinched deeply
                                           into her arms as he held her. She paused, breathing hard. After
                                           awhile she dimbed across the seat, then lay there supine and
                                           panted, her hands holding onto the side while the coolie pedaled
                                           away, the air lifting strands of her white hair.
                                            That's how Grandma was sent to the hospital. A figure in white

                                            Father went indoors, bundled up the pillow and sheets, and left
                                           for the hospital.

                                            Within a week Grandma was back. I thought she was getting
