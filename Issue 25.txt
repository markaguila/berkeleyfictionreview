                         Among the many tasks facing us as editors of the Berkeley
                         Fiction Review, one stands out for its perplexing yet entertaining
Faculty
                         nature. This is the duty of retroactively assigning some theme
Stephen Booth            for the issue—crafting coherence from the creative chaos of
                         thirteen stories, each selected solely on its own merits rather
                         than adherence to such a theme.
Publications
                         This chaos mirrors that of our staff. Because of our
Xavier Hernandez
                         democratic process for selecting submissions, our editorial
                         voice reflects our entire'staff. And because most of our staff
                         changes twice each issue, that voice may sound like white
Alumna                   noise.

                         There is, however, a consistent undertone throughout this
                         confusion. That tone is one of dedication. All of our staff
                         members appreciate great stories (although they may disagree
                         about which stories are great) and are dedicated to finding
                         and recognizing these exceptional pieces. Many fight
                         passionately for the inclusion of their favorite stories.

                         The other constant is us. We have both been here since
                         before work on this issue began, and have had the privilege of
                         receiving manuscripts from writers all over the world who
                         consider our"publication worthy of their work. We have also
                         had the privilege of working with a dedicated staff that let
                         only the very best submissions survive an editorial meeting.

                         And now, our final privilege: This year's theme is alienation.
                         All of our stories for this issue can be seen as showing people
                         alienated from their goals, society, or each other. We make no
                         claim that this theme was on our authors' minds.

                         Whether or not you identify with (or can find) this imposed
                         theme, welcome to the controlled chaos of our magazine.

                         Sincerely,

                         Michael Grisolia                                     Juliana Yee

tight real hug like the one when we said good-bye at graduation.

and New Fallers shoot past you. Your community, if you were in one, drops away.

with feathers. Your fall slows so much. You feel as if you are truly suspended in air.
You have forgotten your descent before. But the wind, he sound of the wind was
always present. For the first time it is gone. The silence is deafening.

                or one disconcerting moment Charles thought the man and woman
                were coming to sit with him.
              j Charles Osgood is a semi-regular at the Royal Booth Bar. The Royal
    Booth is frequented by people like Charles—the upward bound men and women
    who keep the nation's money turning over. These are the people of
    Manhattan's financial district, where the Royal Booth is located on the street
    level of one of the district's tallest buildings. Immediately above it are twenty
    stories of hotel rooms, and immediately above these, thirty more stories of office
    space. Charles works on one of the floors high above the bar. Home is a nearby
    two-bedroom condominium apartment with a large, though neglected, kitchen
    and a view for which Charles paid more than he should have. The Royal is a
    convenient stop on the way from one to the other.
         Some time ago, after work on a Friday, Charles took his gin and tonic from
    the bar. It was early. The Royal was almost empty. No one would object to him
    having a quick drink alone at a booth.
         Charles loosened his tie. As he sat sipping his drink, his mind wandered.
    But in a few minutes his languishing was disturbed. A couple was walking
    towards him. The woman was tall and slender. She wore a dark blue business
t   suit. The tight skirt ended at her knees. Her face was long, her cheek bones
    high, and her mouth wide. Her hair was short, red, and swept back. She was
    stunning. Charles kept glancing at her.

     Sarah screams. High and loud. Her screaming shivers the tops ofthe tallest
sheltering trees. "My baby, my beautiful baby." And then she is crying in silent,
shaking sobs.
     Everyone is quiet. They look at one another, a circle of sad faces, Sarah in
the middle of these women whose babies live a world away. These women who
can't bring their own children to the park; they are left behind in Senegal,
Jamaica or Peru. Sarah has watched them passing pictures; once or twice she's                         U     P

     One ofthe women, so black she's blue, her hair in tiny beaded braids,
stoops down and picks up the baby. Sarah can see scars down her back as the
woman wraps the baby in the blanket Sarah made, when she was waiting, during
the bad time, when he was only twelve days old. She never got to bring him                            b y       M a t t h e w      M a i n
home. The woman brings it back to Sarah. "S'OK... s'OK..." she murmurs,
softly. Her face is creased. She pulls Sarah into her long thin arms.
     Sarah can feel the woman's heart—bah bum, bah bum, bah bum. She closes
her eyes. She wants to stay like this forever, in this circle. No one speaks.

     When my mother was preparing for my death, while 1 still lay in bed with a weak

she had given the funeral home only her last name. When her body arrived, its
name matched the one attached to my specially constructed casket, and in deference
to the dead no questions were asked. I only discovered the mistake on the morning
ofthe funeral. No one said a word but the gravedigger whom I overheard grumbling
about his extra work.

growing altogether, but that my heart, just as it's always done, is still keeping up
right along with everything else. I can feel it chugging away peacefully, right now.
I told him I don't know when I'll stop growing either, but that I'd let him know when
I decide.
