                ou may have seen my ex-boyfriend, Lenny, on TV a few weeks ago.
                He was the skinny guy, tall too, wearing clunky unlaced brown boots
                and a denim jacket with a painted skull on the back that his kid brother
      decorated for him, and he was tearing through grocery stores late at night
      squeezing the loaves of bread 'til they were twisted and unsellable. He did this
      for a few weeks before the supermarket managers caught on and informed the
     news people. That first night on the news there were just the grainy images cap-
     tured on supermarket surveillance, but once they caught him, two nights later,
     they showed his senior portrait from high school where he looked all scrubbed
     down and innocent, his wavy brown hair hardened with so much gel and hair-
     spray that I remember touching his hair on picture day and hearing a sound like
     knocking on a hollow Easter egg.
               During his bread squeezing spree, Lenny insisted that supermarkets
     didn't have surveillance cameras. "Lizzie," he said, "Who's going to steal
     chicken thighs or a can of peas?" After the third week of bread squeezing
     though, Ma and I were watching the local news and they showed the surveil-
     lance tapes of Lenny, who they'd dubbed the Bread Bandit. The newscaster
     said, "The Bread Bandit has hit local stores twelve times in the last three
     weeks," and Ma said, "Hey, I know that jacket!" and I said, "No, Ma," but she
     got up all close to the TV, her nose almost touching the screen, and said, "Oh
     that's Lenny all right with that goddamned Satan jacket and untied shoelaces." I
     could hear the excitement in her voice because Ma had never liked Lenny, said
     he was going nowhere, and wanted a good excuse to break us up. Ma got on
     the phone and called the police while I stood there wanting to hack through the
     phone cord while she spelled out Lenny's name nice and slow and made me give

           hen we first moved into the house on Mechanic Street Mama said we
           had to go down into the cellar and touch the dead man because we
          I would be living on top of him. We didn't think nothing ofthe request,
only that it made us a little scared. We went down into the cellar one by one and
our fingertips filled up with awe as Mama's voice trailed after us saying, Go on,
Go touch the dead man, He won't bite you, He's dead, This gonna be our home
for a long, long time.
          I remember her eyes lifting up like bees before she said this, the dead
man in the cellar listening with extra long bat ears that curved around every
sound. So each of us went down into the cellar and touched him and paid our
respects: Serena on the forehead, Buck on the arm, Tommy near his cardboard
stomach, and me on the bridge of his nose. And our touches went Ooh, our
touches went Aah when we touched the dead man, the impressions we left with
our fingers slowly filling out to what they were before, like water seeping into
low places.
          This was back in 1955 when a pretty single mother with three kids took
what she could get and her children circled around her like pinwheels racing in
the wind. The only house Mama could rent was one where a dead man lay, his
cause of death unknown, his last hours a far-off mystery. The dead man died a
long time ago and you could feel it in the walls, how they breathed back at you
from dark, musty corners. We never asked, Why isn't the dead man buried in the
cemetery like other folks? Because by then we were already rearranging him in
our minds, setting him up around our hopes and fears of what we would become.
The dead man was nothing much to look at, kind of lonely and woebegone with
hairy hands one on top ofthe other. Serena liked to brush them with a comb. His

it brimmed over with brightness, until you almost wanted to be blind and swept
up inside it so nothing was left of you, not bone, skin or the x-rays of your
hands. I drive by the old house sometimes, which is gonna be bulldozed for a
new parking lot, and I can almost hear Mama's humming on the rocking swing
ofthe porch. Where does the past go when you're no longer yourself? Where
does it go? What do you do with the dead you bump up against as lifelong
companions? And was the dead man bitter before he died? The questions swim
around inside my head like dolphins, but their fins are sharp and can cut you up
if you get too close. Mama's fanning herself with a piece of cardboard with the
sun going down, fireflies off and on near the big locust tree, like lights that have
minds of their own. They get brighter and softer, brighter and softer, like they're
feeling out the air, touching and holding it with their wings that can hardly bear
the beauty of it. War and suffering are a long way off, troubling rumors in the
distance that want to matter so much in their own minds, but next to Mama
humming and the dead man in the cellar they just don't seem very important
at all. Mama cut enough hair in one day to weave an acre of waving grass, she
liked to say. The dead man's in the cellar growing straw out of his mouth. You
want to touch the roots coming off his tongue. Earlier that day long ago in June,
you stood next to his body when the light came flooding in like it was going to
melt the windows. You dared to place your hand under the dead man's head and
tilt it up toward the windows and tried to keep the shock and the joy in, saying
over and over, See, I told you mister, I told you: you don't have to have a broken
heart no more because the light is coming and it's gonna heal up your heart pure
and clean even if it takes forever.

on myself, but can't seem to work my arm right. Almost on its own, my hand

like this came out on the front pages ofthe Times not too long after the scandal
broke, the candidate with his hand on his daughter's shoulder, her eyes watching
him, searching his face.

Liddie's climbing the rope. I'm on the mat, below her; she asked me to hold on,

       He twists his lips, considering. "What'd she do?"
       I think about her face, white against the wood ofthe gymnasium ceiling,
blue eyes bent at the comers. There were scabs on her knees, I remember, and
her calves looked soft and pale. I remember the feel of those legs, the muscles
loose beneath the skin, her toenails sharp when she'd kick me under the table at
McDonald's.
       "Nothing."
       He nods. "That's not so bad. I figured maybe she killed herself. Or ran
off or something."
       "No," I say. "Nothing like that." I can still see her eyes, staring down at
me, her knuckles red from gripping the rope. I don't know what I'd hoped for
from telling, if I'd really wanted to hurt her. Maybe I thought she'd go nuts like
her mother, sooner or later, but after she slid down and rubbed her face with an
arm, I knew it wouldn't happen.
       "Nah," says the governor, sitting beside me, hands on his glass. He must

Which is what Ellen had said to Mrs Burton.                                                            Number 19. Five past four.

          Her face was now moody and suspicious, like her mother's.                               'How can you tell my house used to be here?'
          'Truly,' I said.                                                                        'You have to find out. You're supposed to look harder.'

          She nodded.                                                                   wall she said, 'Cold!' So I looked at the west wall, and she said 'Hotter!' But
          'You said you knew what I'd lost.. .Do you?'                                  when I approached the wall, she said, 'Colder!,' then broke into giggles.
          She nodded again. Her thumb went to her mouth, which reminded me                        I looked at her sternly - very sternly, fighting back tears. She stopped
that I was dealing with a little girl.                                                  giggling. I said, 'Would you like to tell me why this is a special room?*
          'And do you want to tell me what it is?'                                                'Because it's haunted.'
          She rocked from side to side, then took her thumb from her mouth.                       'And what makes you think that?'
'Your house.'                                                                                     'Because ofthe noises.'
          It was like a punch in the stomach. I crouched down, out of breath.                     'Noises your daddy makes?'
My face was level with hers. 'Your Mummy told you. Didn't she.'                                   'No. When he's out, silly. And Mummy's gone to pick up Tim.'
          She shook her head.                                                                     'What sort of noises?'
          'I don't believe you. After I left, she told you, didn't she. Didn 't she.'             She made a long face and raised her arms as though they were floating.
          She was scared. I found that I was holding her by the shoulders.              'Whooooooo,' she went. A child's impression of a ghost.
          'It's the truth,'she said. 'I don't tell lies. Ever.'                                   'Rebecca. Are you playing games with me?'

         Mimicking her mother or her father, she nodded thoughtfully to herself.                  'So how come you're not scared now?'
A car went down the road. I didn't have much time before Mrs Burton got back.                     She thought for a moment. 'Because I'm here with you.'
          'I know your house used to be here. I can tell. There's a special room.                 'Very clever,' I said. I tried to contain my anger, but it was difficult.

Wake up, I said Wake up, wake up, over and over again, like a chant. Then the
worst thing occurred to me, and the chant became a whimper. I laid her flat and
listened for her heart, pressing my ear against her ribs. As I did so I prayed. All
I could hear was myself, my own heart, my bronchial, fluted gasps.
          So I began to pump on her chest with both hands. This is the worst
part: the more I pumped, the more lifeless she looked. Pump, wait, pump, wait.
It was how they did it on television. Please, God, may I be doing this right.
Then the kiss of life from my foul mouth: no breath back. Kiss again, holding
her nose, pressing after on her stomach, and the air she breathed out, mine and
her's mixed, wasn't human. I dug my thumb into her wrist: no pulse. I worked
at her heart again, and with each thrust her lips retracted until her teeth were
bared in a rictus.
          I saw dead creatures when I was a child. Squirrels that we sometimes
managed to hit with our catapaults in the woods. A rabbit once, limp and hot
in the long grass, stood over by a farmer and his smoking shotgun. And I saw
Jenny in her cocoon of hospital curtain. I know how it looks.

          I was lying by her side when the front door opened; a rise in air pres-
sure, then a soft thump as it closed. Urgent voices downstairs. A man called to
Rebecca. Ellen called to me. They were looking for us.
          'Rebecca?'
          'Becky!'
          'Jack?'
          I heard Mrs Burton and Ellen conferring. Mrs Burton sounded weepy.
Ellen's voice was different now: authoritative, steely, and stripped (I could tell;
even though I could not hear her words, I could tell) of any kindness for me, as
if she already knew what had happened, and had judged me.
          I picked up Rebecca; something in my shoulder snapped. Footsteps
pounded up the stairs. I got ready. I would hold out their daughter to them. It
would surely be better to do that than let them find her on the floor. As if it
made a difference. The footsteps were on the landing, then they hunted from

still making the duck sound and I finally turn around to look at him. Even after
all this time, he's still got that angel dust glaze in his eyes, as if torching his
brain is the only thing he'll ever remember. His face and neck are broken out
in a bumpy red rash from where Jill tried to shave him this morning. His white
t-shirt is soaked with slobbers, stained with his grandmother's watery gravy.
Every time Jerry attempts the duck, his tongue pops out, and spit runs off his
chin, down his neck. I fumble around, then pull a napkin from one ofthe sacks
of food and wipe his face. When my hand brushes against his jaw, his eyes close
like a puppy's.
           The other boys are helping the driver back up; they're talking big
now, strutting around like they've got shit in their pants. I stick my head out
the window and growl like a dog. Then I give them the finger. The girl in the
window yells, "Fat motherfucker!" I turn back around and blast my horn, hold
it down for a long minute. "My God," Jill says. "Oh, my God." She's holding
her hands over her ears.
           "Hey, Jerry," I say, "you wanta drive?" I drop the Chevy into low, and
rev the engine until the Dairy Queen's windows are rattling. The customers
inside are staring at us and I wave at them. In my side mirror, I see the manager
approaching cautiously from behind and talking on a cell phone. Suddenly,
gunk breaks loose in the carburetor and a huge puff of black smoke shoots out of
the tailpipe.
           "You're going to jail," Jill loudly proclaims.
           I laugh and pull out fast onto High Street, burning rubber, honking the
horn. "Slow down!" Jill screams. "What the hell is wrong with you?"
           I slide the Zippo from my pocket and squeeze the small metal case, rub
it between my fat sweaty fingers. It has two dates engraved on it, like a tomb-
stone. I toss the lighter out the window and shift the Chevy into second gear,
then stomp the gas pedal and squeal down the street. People hanging out on
their porches point at us as we rocket past in third. An old lady grabs a little girl
up off the sidewalk. A siren begins to whine in the distance.
           Suddenly, happiness rips through me like a sword. Reaching over,
I grab Jill's knobby knee, but she shoves my hand away. "Kak, Kak!" Jerry
squawks, as he bounces forward against his restraints. A police car is coming up
behind us, all of its lights throbbing. The trees, the signs, the entire world, start
to bend backwards as we race up the highway. "Kak, Kak!" Jerry goes again,
and I almost grit my teeth. But then, sliding the gearshift into fourth, I start
over.

brown bangs grazing cheeks like a cherub masking how promiscuous everyone
said he was sleeping with the loosest girl in school and drinking beer and smok-

       Danny was eighteen and long and lean, with a sinewy body that he moved
like a ballet dancer aware ofthe space above and below him, but casual like a
jungle cat stretched out on the bed next to me, against me, chestnut curls pushed
past cloudy eyes lips ripe like an heirloom tomato musing over the beauty ofthe
human body —my human body—a work of art, his words were true and the oth-

was ghostlike, dreamlike - his voice deep and throaty he wondered if he would

know who he would become.

                   y wife became pregnant very suddenly. One night she suggested I put
                   some pickles on her Haagen-Dazs. The next morning she looked ready
                   to pop. What's going on here, she asked upon noticing the basketball-
         sized lump that had taken up residence in her belly. Did you do this?

                The doctor seemed unconvinced that the entire situation had sprung up
         overnight, and he looked at me more strangely each time I repeated the story. I
         asked if it might be a reaction to the pickles, or the ice cream, or the combina-
         tion of both. He remained skeptical.
                   It's not pickle related, he said.
                But I made a mental note to throw them out, along with the ice cream,
         just to be safe. The doctor checked and double checked his tests and scans and
         declared that we were no longer eligible to receive the traditional nine month
         preparation time. In fact, he said my wife could give birth at any minute.
                   Well, she said, forcing a smile, that really doesn't give us much time
         does it?
                   We did our best not to appear blindsided as we rushed out and began to
         collect all the tools required for proper child-rearing. While we were purchasing
         the crib, diapers, and high chair, my wife kept pulling up her shirt, studying her
         belly in disbelief, mourning the loss ofthe perfect abs she'd been religiously
         honing for an hour each morning before going to work.
                While we collected the mobiles, music boxes, and pacifiers, my wife
         consulted the detailed calendar she used to ensure a smooth and even flow to our
         lives. Normally she could say with certainty which cases I'd handle for a given
         week, or where we would dine on a Wednesday evening six months hence, but it

       Where are you going?
       Back where I came from.
       You can do that?
       Sure.
       How?
       It's complicated. But you guys are going to be fine, don't you worry, I'm
sure of it.
       How do you know?
       Well, it's not like I have a crystal ball or anything. A telephone yes, crys-
tal ball no. But I can tell. Please let mom know I love her and thank her for the
ride. I'm going to miss you guys.
       We'll miss you. Very much. Will we ever see you again?
       Of course.
       When? Where?
       It's complicated.
       There was a pause and then, I love you dad. Good-bye.
       Good-bye.
       The line went dead and I held the phone to my ear and listened to the
drone ofthe dial tone until the operator took it away. I dropped the phone in the
cradle, and I went to bed.

        When we woke the next morning my wife was skinny as a rail and the
mere idea of anything with pickles made her ill. I told her about the phone call
and she seemed saddened, but somehow able to understand.
       For a while we weren't sure what to do. We decided that what was re-
quired was a send off of some sort, something better than a late night phone call
to say goodbye.
       A funeral seemed too sad, so we decided on a graduation, though we
didn't specify from what. We invited all our friends and the baby's now pre-teen
contemporaries. My wife taped a mortarboard to her abdomen, and we opened
the thoughtful gifts of Cross pens and personalized stationary that our visi-
tors had brought. Everyone was careful not to mention that the guest of honor
was absent, that the graduate, had in fact, already moved on. They just smiled
politely and we smiled back.
        Six months later, among the thank yous and other mailed pleasantries from
all our invited guests, we found a folded note with no postage. On the front was
a crude drawing of a kite blowing in the wind and inside, the paper revealed
itself to be a piece of graduation stationary. There was no signature, no letter, no
explanation at all. Just two words, Thank You, that appeared to be written with a
fountain tipped Cross Pen.

for a successful suicide. I decided that I had no alternative but to live a while
longer.
           I frantically dialed 911.
          Within minutes of placing the call I found myself reading the ingre-
dients ofthe drain opener aloud to a woman at Poison Control. The fact that
my voice was not the hideous rasp that I had expected was my first clue that
something had gone wrong with my suicide preparations. When I got through
the list of ingredients it became clear that my sister Amy's meddling had ruined
yet another brilliantly conceived suicide plot.
       Amy, the Earth-protecting, environmental activist, had replaced my Drano
with some natural, Earth-friendly, organic goop. According to the woman at
Poison Control, while the concoction I drank might be perfectly effective for
clearing hair from a drain, it packed no punch as a toxin. Thanks to my sister,
my entire digestive tract now teemed with live cultures, healthy bacteria, and
vital enzymes. If I'd followed the drain opener with a chaser of milk I could
have churned out yogurt.
          Life is indeed full of spectacular inconveniences. But those incon-
veniences occasionally contain pleasant surprises. As I noted earlier, I am an
unusually sensitive man. After I had recovered from the dual shocks of my
disruptive desire to live and my discovery of yet another unpardonable act of
interference on the part of my sister, I heard a hint of something special in the
voice ofthe woman from Poison Control. In her inflections, I clearly detected
the intonations of a waltz lover. Of course, I immediately told her all about
ARNO and the upcoming concert. Due to the restrictions on her job—she is a
consummate professional—she could not overtly express her interest. Her boss
was likely leaning over her shoulder demanding that she follow some foolish
script. But even as she repeatedly advised me to seek the advice of a mental
health professional, she coquettishly telegraphed her true feelings toward me
through a subtle, but clear, Viennese-y oom-pah-pah rhythm in her speech.
          After hanging up I made calculations ofthe number of bottles of poi-
sonous liquids lying about the house. I figured that I could call my new friend at
Poison Control once a week for two months claiming to have sipped from one of
them without having to repeat toxins. If I was right about her interest in me, and
I undoubtedly was, come July we'd be sitting hand and hand watching Andre"

about her the whole time I'm in class, through recess, walking home. No one
knows, though. The only sign I give is writing "Sugy + Pablo = Love" on the
back of my three ring binder.
      She seems unreachable, though. Like the angels in my catechism bible.
They hang right above our heads trying to get us to do the right thing and we
don't even know they're there. Those angels seem powerless over what we do.
They're just there kinda hoping in a powerful and floaty way, but they seem to
not be able to just bend down and whisper what to do in our ear. I think it's a
shame to let that mess of sword they got just go to waste.

                    that he had an insatiable appetite for praise, and was not above using sympathy
                    to get it. Sympathy was something most people offered him freely. I guess it

     sky, and that it feels a little hotter than orange. Mostly I forget because I can't
     describe it, or don't really want to.
               "What color do you feel now?" I ask him.
               He puzzles. It's like asking a baby to recite Shakespeare, but he's good
     at faking, so I let him stew on it.
               "Yellow," he finally says.
               "Are you saying yellow because I just described it, or because it's re-
     ally the way you feel?" I ask him.
               This obviously upsets him. I can see his face flush, and his eyes strain-
     ing at something distant— maybe the horizon.
               "Black... maybe," he restates. He is unsure.
               Maybe there is black in his sunset.
               "Let me explain it again," I say to him. He is obviously relieved.
               So I describe the sunset to him again. How the clouds drifted above the
     mountains, their wide bodies catching in strings across the green heads ofthe
     trees that stretch to meet the impossibly blue sky.
               I painted Heaven in his unseeing gaze.
               I crept up behind him and placed my hands on his shoulders; my face
     next to his; my mouth so near his ear that I could whisper. I felt my words enter-
     ing his head, and I could almost see the picture they made in his imagination—
     the sunset through his dead eyes.
•f
               It was beautiful.
               "Keep looking," I told him.
               "Can you see it?"
               "Yes," he said, "I think so."
               "Keep looking," I said to him. I knew he saw it.
               The sunshine was blue like the sky. His body was weightless, like a
     bird's in flight. I watched the sun set behind the mountains, then walked the
     path back to the car alone.
               I knew he had seen it.
               In the bowl ofthe valley, beyond the broken trees through which he
     fell, and past the frozen streaks of cloven earth, he lay with crimson fingers curl-
     ing into tiny pools around his head.
               Their color mimicked the sunset.
               His eyes were fixed on the sky, I knew he had seen it.
               I had explained red to him after all.
