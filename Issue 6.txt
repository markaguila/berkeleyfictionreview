              H e. er cigarette burned a line, then settled, grew. I dropped my
              head back and listened, the sweat drying off me. On Amsterdam
              the traffic brushed past with a sound not like rain but almost. Her
              hand landed on me softly, just under my navel. I froze. It was still
              the first time. I wondered how long it would be. She held me and I
              curled around her hand, not wanting to change anything but
              needing to curl.
                    When Kristen banged on the door it seemed still night, but it
              was nine. She wasn't allowed to bang before nine. Rachel lifted
              her leg from me leaving a wet oval. She stirred and made noises
              on my chest that I could feel. "Wait," I said. She nodded no and in
              a minute was up. The pale, sunless marks on her cheeks made
              them smaller. Like slices of yellow cake.
                    When I came out Kristen told me to go. "I want breakfast," I
              said.
                    "Go." She was eleven and said anything.
                    "I'll get doughnuts," I said.
                    'Til come." I wefit and told Rachel in the shower. The steam
              almost drew me in but I didn't even brush my teeth. I'd have time
              while she did breakfast. We walked to Broadway, f counted three
              matchless shoes in the short block. Also an overcoat and a man.
              "What's on his face?" Kristen wanted to know.
                    "Mud," I* said, but it was blood. The shop was packed. She
    vvy-- i   chose two chocolate glazed, two cherry and a cinnamon. Outside
              the sunlight fell white. I couldn't see it when I was walking back
              anymore than on the way to thejshpp. Only from jinside, the light
              breaking like a mist.          * "~
                    Rachel kissed Kristen, then me, but I wouldn't kiss back. I
              went and took a shower, burning myself in it. There was a tiny cut
              on the bottom of my cock—a redness of pulled away skin. I
              wondered ii there was such a thing as calluses and the loss
s             thereof. It seemed plausable. In the mirror my face was an
F             outraged red. I made angry faces and they worked. I put a-and-d
              on the spot and drew on my boxers like bandaging. I could still
              feel it from the soap.

             We ate next to Rachel's manuscript and the pile of books           five or ten years she'd inherit her way back across town, almost
        with markers. They smelled so strongly of dust I could taste it in      down the street from me if she didn't sell into a poorer place. It

             She nodded vaguely. When Max had died he'd left her the
        book to finish. We had that in common—we each had a book. But           both been waiting. Still everything shifted minutely. The grey day

        him the way everyone wants to be mourned. But then it was over          about my coming. I looked around the small, yellow room. Anne's
        and she was all there. It was too good.                                 room. Arine, naked, pregnant, Terry's fingers on her taut belly
              "I'm going riding with Julie, you know," Kristen told her.        like a doctor's fingers, confident. Holding what's there.
              "I know."                                                               "You think she'll come back," I said. Rachel looked at me,

            Happened to the Hebron boy. Fact is, they being such a
            thoughtless clan, wasn't till he was near half a year that anyone
            gave much care. Then it was hardly more than setting him to a
            corner, boarded in to keep him from under booted foot. And, I
            suppose, kind of out of sight.

            Fact is, I hadn't known he was blind till I heard him hollering at
            his hold. Just noising out toward nothing he could see. Eyes as
            blank as my hand. Beyond me, hadn't they been brought to court
            for poaching on a cow - no saying who'd ever known.


                 Iourse the county health people pushed in to take off for some
            kind of home. But us townfolk shied from interference and said

            Course you know from the prattle that's about what happened
            last week. The Hebron boy being long a man by now. Still blind

                 he boy paused at the bus stop, hesitantly looking into Laura's
           eyes. There was something very sad and appealing about them.
           They were brown and unsheltered—on the verge of being broken
           or misplaced—but a frankness held them fast and at instants
           defined. Now they looked directly at him and he searched himself,
           surprised at the complicated sensation. He did not feel naked or
           disoriented; he was not an insecure person. The blunt
           vulnerability in front of him only made him slightly nervous. He
           kissed her good-bye and still, watched her scramble to catch her
h          bus. It was getting dark. Shoving his hands in the pockets of his
           long black coat, he moved onto the busy sidewalk and began to
           walk home.
                 He saw himself passing through the crowd alone. The
           chilled air against his skin made his cheeks and nose feel taut* He
           walked by a street musician who had long tangled blong hair that
           merged into a frizzled beard. His body looked emaciated under his
           lightweight flannel shirt. There was an open guitar case in front
           of him. It contained several centimes. The boy stopped and
V      l   listened as the forlorn guitarist broke into six consecutive Bob
           Dylan songs. He concentrated completely on the figure before
           him, not moving his eyes or his body. Every time a member of the
           crowd swirling by bumped into or jostled him, he felt a
           heightened sense of the difference between their awareness and
           his own. The guitarist was not a good guitarist, but he looked cold
           and hungry. The boy dropped two francs into the case and asked
           the man where he was from. _ _
               t "I come from Germany.*^
                 The boy nodded solemnly and asked him why he'd come to
           France. "I need rrioney. I have no job in Germany. I want to travel
           so I came to France and play the guitar. I make no money here so I
           guess I £p back to Germany soon."
                 "Oh. Do you have family there?"
                 The boy winced as his voice cracked on "family" and went

         bending her head for his answer as if she were taller than he,        the coffee table. He saw one faded black-and-white photograph of

    JL pulled her by the hand. I wanted to show her my fort on the
    side of the hill. It was still raining, as it had been for a week. It
    seemed the hill would slide away, and only bare rock would be left,
    without my fort of branches, bushes, and stones. I had to show her
    my fort before it was washed down the hill into the apartment
    buildings and mud of the basketball courts.
         The sky was the usual overcast brown. Several Turkish Air
    Force jets screamed overhead, and we stopped to watch them. She
    walked ahead, disgusted with my infatuation with the military.
    But she'd consented to see my fort, which I'd spent a full month
    working on. Graham and Cliff and I were best friends, and we
    shunned all others during recess to hide in our fort, re-build it
n   when other gangs took it apart, and prepare for winter, when
    snow would abolish passive warfare. I'd built my own fort, and in
    the back of my mind I knew I was finally going to impress her
    with it.
         As she walked ahead of me I could smell her hair. It was
    raining very hard, it was late in the afternoon, and my mom
    expected me home half an hour before. Debbie's mother taught a
    late music class, so she was safe, I watched her as I walked, and
    reached for her, but missed on purpose. She turned her head.
    "Maybe I want to be a pilot" I said, and she laughed. "Only
    Canadian pilots will live" she said.
         In October it rained on Ankara for days without stopping.
    Then it would cease, and the pollution would settle in on the mud.
    The streets would dry up and the dirt would turn to dust. The
    buses created a very palpable.exh£ust, and there were always jets
    overhead. My dad came home with news clippings about Cyprus;
    it was 1973. I remember vaguely a colour photograph of the
    carnage of war, on the cover of TIME magazine. I remember
    looking at the date and thinking, I am seven, and when I have
    lived seven years over again, I will still be too young to be holding
    a gun and looking like that.
         We came to the jumble of branches and stones clustered in
    front of three bushes—that was my fort. I had a flag of blue cloth

        and fled down the hill. "It's water-tight" I said. "I'm going to build                         Cynthia      Eagleton
        two more for Graham and Cliff and me. You can be with us, too."
              She looked at me and laughed. "Okay," was all she said. I
        looked at the blue flag and said that I put it there because I knew
        she liked blue. Once she gave me a test to see if we were matched
        or not. I picked the colour blue, which meant we were. Everyone

beneath the surface, that reminded him of everything else and
everthing else set him to bawling again. He bawled until the lack
inside him became as a vessel and then he rubbed the heels of his
hands across his eyes and his nose and he mounted the bicycle and
rode back for what he had forgotten.

     Llicia lay on the bed in the dark, touching her ribs, hipbones,
thighs. Although she was wrapped in blankets, she felt cold. The
room she shared with Peter was really a sun porch. All summer
they had looked out at the plum tree, and honeysuckle and felt the
sun through the glass. But now it was December and raining. The
tree in the yard was a skeleton.
   Alicia's stomach made noises like a cat as she curled up under
the blankets. She did not shut her eyes because she was avoiding
the image—the naked body, all bones and whiteness crouched in a
marble box. But she could not escape the voice in her head as
easily.
   I will not eat cakes or cookies or food. I will be thin, thin pure. I
will be pure and empty like glass.
   That morning, the psychiatrist had asked, "Why are you
starving yourself?" and she had known all the right answers.
Escaping the responsibilities of growing up, having control over
something at least, being beautiful^ perfect for once, making
people pay attention, love her. She smiled to herself that she
could know all this and still skip dinner, still jog five miles in the
rain. She had not told the psychiatrist about Peter.


a ftiring her first months at the university, her first year away
from home, she had wandered on, the campus looking into the
faces of the men. Then, at a party, she had seen Peter wearing a
white shirt and drinking gin.

   "My writing frustrates me," he said. "I want it to change
things."
   When he kissed her goodnight and held her for a moment, she
was surprised at how cool his skin felt, except for the heat in the
hollow of his back. The memory of that heat through his thin
shirt stayed in her palms all night. She said his name out loud in
the dark.

M , Lae Johnson, age 62, a massive woman, lived a life of quiet
desperation, as did most of her neighbors in the boarding house.
Her husband, a bartender at the Happi-I, had died slowly after a
fall which had broken his hip. He spent the last six months of his
life in a hospital bed, his life draining away with his savings. He
and Mae were smart about buying medical insurance but it just
didn't cover all the expenses and by the time Jim died, most of
what he'd intended to retire on was gone. There was enough to
pay for a funeral, which Mae attended alone. Then she settled into
her new life, spending her mornings sealing enveloped for a big
housewares distributor. At noon, she dropped off the envelopes
and went marketing. She saved her Green Stamps and redeemed
them by mail. She didn't have the energy to work in the after-
noons, so she sat in a chair by her window, watching the sun,
which just missed her apartment at its height except for a few
days a year. Had she lived one floor up, she could have had light all
year round. Sometimes she read the catalogues that Green
Stamps sent her.
   Mae and Jim had no children. And since Mae hardly ever social-
ized with Jim gone, the phone never rang. Mae once filled out a
form which would have cancelled her service, but she ended up
keeping it because a nice woman named Joan from the telephone
company offices called and urged her not to disconnect it. She told
Mae about a senior citizen's discount. Mae would qualify in a few
years, Joan had said, so shouldn't she just hold onto it for a little
while? Mae liked the sound of Joanjs voice. Shejasked if Joan
would ever call her again. Joan "said yes. Mae kept the phone.
   Mae sold Herbalife or, at least, she'd sent away for the
membership and had put the sticker which said "LOSE WEIGHT
NOW: ASK ME HOW" on her door, but no one had asked her
yet. She'd been thinking about getting in touch with Amway,
who'd sent her a pamphlet after she'd joined Herbalife, but she
couldn't make up her mind. She kept the information from Green
Stamps, Herbalife and Amway by her window in a milk crate. It
was old and grey and made out of plastic.

chair. Mae had arthritis but she didn't think it was too bad so she
never did anything about it. The phone rang again. Mae eased one
leg to the floor and the chair began to tip over so she gingerly
raised herself back onto the seat. She crouched down again and
lowered her leg once more. She turned slightly and found her
balance perfectly so that she could put first one, then the other
leg, to the kitchen floor. But the bottom of her dress was caught
on the ironing board and when she started walking to the phone,
the spring mechanism forced the board up and pulled Mae back
against the wall. She hung there for a second. The phone rang
again and she feebly reached out towards it with both hands and
felt her dress pulling against her armpits and she kicked her legs
sensing that the ground was just out of the reach of her toes,
embarrassed because her slip was showing. Her dress tore with a
loud noise and she landed on her feet and she immediately
stumbled to the phone.
   "Hello? Hello?"
   "Hi, ma'am. This is Don Bone. What's your favorite radio

   "Excuse me?"

   Mae paused. "I don't understand."
   Done Bone laughed. "Hah hah. I'm calling randomly through-

   "Well, I'm sorry, but I don't have the radio."
   "Ohh, that's too bad. If you'd said KYOW, we'd have had a

we've got a KYOW "Fun-in-the-Sun" t-shirt and a KYOW

      he street scared Paul. Its traffic weaved wildly, with cars and
trucks rearing at green lights like war horses, then buckling to
halts at red lights, stomping and snorting, waiting to bolt free
again. Paul eyed the street warily as he headed down the sidewalk.
Despite the strange new landscape—the grand and squalid park,
the fetid gutter, the graffitied border wall—the street held his
attention most.
   He walked 15 blocks before spotting any people. Then at 61st
Street, a crowd appeared and blocked his route. With his new
job's tight schedule he couldn't afford any delay. He thought of
chancing the street, but the mere notion made his throat tight and
breathing difficult. He picked up his pace, hoping to sneak around
them, certain they'd resent anyone pulling ahead of them. The
people in the crowd, well-dressed in business suits, were notor-
iously vicious. He'd seen clips on the TV news of them attacking
people without provocation. He crept closer, tightening his
stomach muscles and fisting his hands, ready for someone to grab
him. A woman, spying him when only feet away, glared at his
maneuvering, and her gaze pushed him into the street. A yellow
cab brushed past him, fumes spilled out of its rusted tailpipes and
clouded his nostrils. Sweat dampened Paul's suit, and he covered
his face with his hands, then hugged the curb. Careful not to near
the pack, his eyes darting back and forth, Paul inched by them. But
cars and buses in the cross-street stopped him from getting to the
other side. As he waited, the crowds' anger elbowed his back,
nudged him into the busy avenue. Hferesistedby digging his heels
into the pavement, softirom'the August heat. Finally, the street
cleared and Paul scrambled across.
   He relaxed a few blocks later. Trees formed a leafy canopy,
permitting patches of sunlight to hit the walk. Paul, glancing at
his watch, saw he was only seconds behind schedule. He hurried
up and tried not to be distracted by the surroundings. Yet a black
man curled up on a bench caught his eye. The man was shirtless,
and tufts of hair sprouted from his chest and stomach. He wore
khaki trousers and dusty black shoes. The whites of his eyes had

    "Hah!" the man said. "You're stuck, and they're coming.                 "The crowd. They'll be here any minute."
 There's nothing you can do about it." His voice was clear and rich.        Paul went to leap at the man, but found he was still paralyzed.

      my old drafts and ideas wouldn't take that much space, so I keep
      them. Now I'm glad I did 'cause I was recently looking at some of
      the old notes where I wrote, "And what moves the universe—is it
      something we can understand, or more akin to madness?" This
      scuttled around in the darkness inside my head for a few days and
      then I decide to make some new plans for my life. Joe the cabbie
      who works at my company said to me, "You dumbfuck, what are
      you doing goin' back to school at this age?" I can only answer him
      with a smile, an idiot smile, I guess, like someone I used to know.
