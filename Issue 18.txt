    As the academic year began and our staff returned to             Trish Cantillon

accelerate. Issue #17 came back from the printer and we secured      I Think"Continually Of Those.   46

    August was also a month of initiating our editorial              Laurel Hunter

resulted in the variety of stories present in this issue. Not only   Provincetown                    71
do the" stories differ thematically and contextually, they also      Stacey Barnett
differ in the ways in which they are understood. Our last story

story, "Beautiful Flower," is part of a larger history of protest    Alicia Erian
in the form of self-immolation.
    These conflicting opinions gave this issue's staff a unique      Wanting A Lover Man             87
dynamic and energy, which carried through to the magazine s          James Braziel

                hadn't left the apartment for several days except for the
              post office and to buy cigarettes and now here were all the
               pretty Mexican girls in the beautiful spring summer night
in the Mission. The radios were playing in the cars and juke boxes in
the taquerias and Galan's and Carlo's and all the other corner bars filled
with men and one or two ( cherubs and the teenage gangster chicks were
on the corner high on bud wearing NBA jerseys and baseball jerseys
and they looked at me but if I glanced back it was like what're you
lookin at gringo? I was walking too fast and I relished the idle time at
the corners when I'd hit a red light. Even if there wasn't any traffic, I d
wait just for the sake of the stoplight and strike a pose 'cause I knew I
was being watched. I passed the ragged streetmen and their shopping
carts and the crack whores gathered on the stqops, so conscious of the
jingle the few coins in my pocket made against the keys.
    All the way down 24th Street by the McDonald's, there were some
fine shapely women but I couldn't gaze at them and I kept slowing my
pace as I turned down Mission Street and it was running so with the
motorbikes and the black-and-whites and the cruisers, and everyone
who wasn't going somewhere was watching from the sidewalk and
grooving to ranchero and rap. I passed the restaurants and more taquerias
and the mirror store and finally looking in one shop, I saw it was still
five minutes to eight and I stopped, at another corner and delicately
pulled out my Zippo and lit a cigarette. And then by luck there was the
red light again so I had another few seconds to dawdle and look around

 my bagel with sun-dried tomato cream cheese. On the bottom corner
of the front page, there was a story about a boy in another country. He
had been captured by soldiers and taken to a field on the edge of a city
not far from his home, along with twenty-nine other men. His captors,                        H i s     L a s t    N i n e        W o r d s

systematically executed them before throwing them onto a pile of at
least a thousand more lifeless men who had been executed in the same
manner. The boy, left for dead, lay bleeding on the pile of dead men
and endured the executions of hundreds more for several days. Finally
a truck arrived. A soldier stepped out and said, "That's it. That's all of
them." The men laughed and one replied, "We had a good hunt today.

    Claire was silent, waiting for me to go on, but I didn't know what
else to say. She stopped rubbing my stomach and turned over on her
back, folding her hands over her chest.
    "I wonder how she decided, though. Don't you ever wonder how
she made up her mind?"
    "Maybe it wasn't a matter of making up her mind. Maybe it was all
very clear to her. Maybe the whole time she was with my father she
knew something was missing."
    "Maybe," she said, and then was silent again. I could see her eyes
were open, staring up at the ceiling. She was still thinking, still working
it all out. I was too tired to stay up with her tonight, I didn't think I
could keep my eyes open another second.
    "It's not so bad, you know?" She looked over at me and waited for
me to agree. "I mean, this house, this life they have together. It makes
me a little envious." She turned to face me and moved her body up into

realized it then. I really did admire my mother for what she had. She
had made a life for herself and it was working. She had everything she
wanted.
    I could feel the pulse of Claire's breath on my chest. She was crying
silently, not wanting me to know. I smoothed her hair and kissed her
forehead, holding her as tightly as I could. There was nothing I could
think to say to her, there was nothing anyone could say, really, to make
it all right. So I just held her and rubbed her back and let her cry until,
finally, she wore herself out and fell asleep in my arms. I lay there holding

director, Werner Herzog, eats his shoe.

    Professor Norton didn't seem to hear.
    "I'll require them to go."

    Ms. Lutz looked at Werner Herzog. He was pulling a strap off a
black boot as he spoke to his audience in a German accent: "If you
have to steal cameras to make a film, steal cameras! The thing is to
make the film."
    Pretentious so and so, Ms. Lutz thought. She looked at Professor
Norton, who had some leftover chocolate cake on the side of his face.
"Don't lie down and get chocolate on the couch," she said.
    "Oh!" Professor Norton said. Werner had swallowed the strap.
    Ms. Lutz looked at the TV. "He'll get constipated."
    When the movie finished, Professor Norton decided he didn't like it
after all. "They hardly showed him eating it. Mostly he just talked."
    Ms. Lutz felt vindicated. She put her feet up on Professor Norton's
lap. She said, "What about my students?"

    I was breathless as I watched her walking. She took deliberate
ballerina steps in the shells. She was thinking about something. I had
to figure out what she was thinking and put it down on paper. Invade
her private musings. I would give her life and she would give me the
story I have always been waiting for. The story that people would read,
and fall in love with, and want to live inside. The kind of story you read
over and over, pretending you don't know what will happen, even though
you do. Wanting to capture that first feeling of the story closing in
around you, like a shrinking skin, which squeezes something out of
you that you haven't felt in years.
    But nothing could prepare me for what she did next. I watched
helpless on the rock, tentative and curious about which direction she
would take. She could have stepped left or right, into the arms of a
prince; she could have gone mad and rolled in the sand until it clumped
up her hair and gown; she could have walked back to her old life, or
fled to her new one. I was drunk on the vertigo of what might happen
next.

     Her tiny feet pointed their way to the ocean. She breathed a sigh of
relief as the surf brushed her ankles. She turned away from me, so I
could not see her face, just the scarves flurrying in the gales of the
storm. They must have been whipping at her face, slapping her with
sand and salt. She must have felt some pain, but she did not react.
Instead she walked calmly forward into the water, the scarves hectic
like tentacles around her. She was walking into the ocean, I realized.
She would keep walking along the bottom of the sea, until her lungs
filled up with snails and sand and seaweed. Until the tiny carcass-feeding
fish had nibbled her eye sockets clean. This was her will, not her fate. I
wanted to call out to her, to ask her why, to change her mind.
     But I was only her painter; I could give her shape and form and
tone and shadow, but the language of her movement was hers. And she
moved into the sea, drawn by some voice of her own imagining. I
watched the water lap up her sides, licking her limbs, swallowing her
hair, until all I could see was the last tentacle of her veil tremble in the
wind for one frozen moment before it disappeared with her hair and
her eyes and her untold stories, beneath the surface, where she would
not let me follow.

                                     grown more flesh and bite in its passing from mouth to
                                     ear, been absorbed, digested, and then come spilling out
                      again, from new mouth. We are feeling troubled these days with the
                      story coming to life and creeping around among us. We are old and
H i                   tired, we do not hear so well as we once did, though our mouths with
                      new teeth are as strong as ever. It ought to be told in some other language,
                      we think—it ought to be spoken in some remote and musical dialect,
                      without one syllable in common with the speech or thought of Chester
                      Krieley, or of his boy Bobby Lee, or even of, we say, Duke Phelps—

                      its, the story's, spit and blood, but we have among us only this one
                      tongue.
                          The Krieley couple have lived, since their marriage, in a house not
                      unlike our own, whose outside walls are sided with aluminum and which
                      sits in the middle of a stretch of yellowed grass in the late summer, this
                      time of year. We all live close enough to each other and far away from
                      anyone else. We are thirty miles from what might be called a city. Both
                      of them grew up here, courted through high school, and married soon
                      after. We used to watch them, in the first days of their marriage, when
                      they sat out on their porch together, and he lit cigarettes and swallowed
                      down the smoke, then let it come curling slowly from his throat, and
                      she closed her eyes and puckered her strawberry mouth and breathed it
                      down. This sharing of smoke was something we had not seen before.

and his son. The boy did this without a great deal of difficulty, though
he is still so young, and so his hands were small and trembling. He took
hold without a great deal of difficulty because the Duke was cold just
out of bed, and in men's terms—this is the way we have heard it told—
undergrown. Bobby Lee trusted his father, whose gun was still fiercely
planted into the side of the man's head. He did just what Chester told
him to do. With the blade of the newly-sharpened straight razor, he cut
the Duke's testicles loose from the rest of him, and then he stood there
holding them while the man howled and convulsed, not knowing exactly
if he should drop them to the ground or hand them to his father. He
stood there comically holding them, we say, in the loud confusion, and
we are afraid even to laugh when we say it. We do not know if Chester
was speaking now, if he made any attempt to explain himself to the
Duke or to explain what kind of lesson this was supposed to be to the
boy, but we doubt anyone could have heard his quiet voice in such a
moment. Finally there was the sound of the shotgun fired into the
Duke's face, which ended the human noise of his howling. He slumped
down to the floor now, into his own blood, in which Chester Krieley
and his son were standing, and into which the boy finally let fall what
he was holding, with two separate, quiet splashes. It frightens us, this
sound: splash, splash. We do not know how to pronounce, to reproduce
it right.
    We have never before had this fear, that just the speaking of
something might corrupt our mouths. We feel betrayed by Chester
and his boy, by his wife too, and by the Duke. We feel they have forced
our jaws and tongues, our voices and our words themselves into new
and uncomfortable positions. There is a new heat in our dry throats
now; the telling threatens to blister our palettes. We do our best to wet
our lips; we close our mouths.
