                              This issue of the Berkeley Fiction Review emerged in painful,
F A C U L T Y             slow convulsions.
                              That makes it better.

                          intellectual assault of our staff members. No story was
Chris Nealon
                          unanimously ushered in; stories that would have been blithely
                          accepted in previous years were rejected. Our staff has never
                          been so selective. For this we thank them.
P U B L I C A T I O N S       Our staff is what differentiates this issue; what remains
                          constant is our commitment to publishing inventive fiction.
George Stilabower         To be accepted, a story had to demand attention; it often had
                          to break some barrier of common fiction-writing sense and
                          survive. Wed like to let the stories speak for themselves, but
                          we can't resist crowing about a few: "The Last Unbelievable
A L U M N I               Inch Of Extra" is quite simply wonderful, a refreshing break
                          from the dour tone of much contemporary fiction. "Away!" is
Grace Fujimoto            stunning stylistically. "Rime Of The Sweaty Girl," "The

Nikki T h o m p s o n
                          Waking" are classic BFR stories, if there is such a thing: they
D a p h n e Young         keep fiction new by playing with conventions. Many other
                          stories excel in a quieter way. Everybody will find a story they
                          enjoy in this issue—we can say this with surety because our
                          staff was so diverse that nearly every taste was represented.
                              The intelligence and hard work of our staff have reaped us
                          other benefits. Our distribution has widened significantly, and
                          we are far more efficient and complete in the evaluation of
                          submissions. Finally, they were simply enjoyable to work with.
                              In the end, however, a good staff is useless without good
                          writers. We thank them for making BFR possible.
                              Now we should get out of the way and let you see for yourself
                          the results of our staff's and writers' dedication. We proudly
                          invite you to explore BFR #19.

                        he water is stained green like the limestone lip of the
                        sinkhole, and it cuts into the skin of his bare ass where he
                        sits, fifteen, naked, dangling his feet into the water. An
         orange tree leans in over the pool, roots corn out like a lens, a provocative
         ellipse, green oranges hard as tumors, crisp with acid. Two of the girls
         sit sidesaddle on the rough trunk, one with arms crossed over her breasts,
         feet crossed at the ankles, thighs tight together and pale, thick, the
         other gathered up knees to chest, heels together and tucked hard against
         herself. Step out into the water, don't think, he tells himself, dive, smooth
         elision. Suddenly breathless with the cold, tumid and thin-limbed.
             The girls drop from the trunk like turtles, slick as fish. The third
         bides her time in the weeds beyond, modest, apprehensive. She's the
         one, blond hair slick as cornsilk, green eyes, skin the shy blue of milk.
         The other two boys swim out, buddies, grinning, swim between the
         girls waiting for him, waiting. Deep breath, lungs, chest, bob and then
         duck under, water tight as a fist. Its when you shy away, you lose, he
         tells himself, girls' eyes watching.
             He pounds down against the fearful buoyant part of himself, moss-
         greased down to the cave, dark spot, quiet, limestone ribbed and arcing
         swung like a spark to another sinkhole sunken cup like a funnel. It slips
         around him smoothly like a foreskin, old hat, old friend, been here
         before, girls wide-eyed and wondering, hands darting in the water like
         minnows when he comes up born again and smiling.

    The depth whines in the bones behind his jaw in the small bones of
his ear and the earth seems to shift to make room for him in her astricted
gut. He struggles, wills himself free, commands his shoulders unjoint
themselves, his tumid heart to swallow its load in one hard wrung gulp.

on the front seat. Leave them where they are. Do not hurry if your
knife slips and falls from nervousness. Slowly pick up the knife and
walk away gradually making yourself disappear by concentrating hard.

   Remember. You are not the one who is crazy and trouble. The doctors
will prescribe pills for you even though you feel fine. They will use the
biggest words to make you less than them. They will loan you books
that you will not read. Take the pills if you want. They will make your
dreams even more vivid.
   Ask the doctors, what about the big bang though. We are suffering
from that. We are all spinning at the same speed being hurled out into
space waiting to snap back into ourselves.
   Say to a stranger on the bus, you will snap back too you know! To
the girls in the tenth grade to the doctors to your mother to your brother.

Love and hate will fly through your bedroom. You will leave the car in
a dark lot if you do things right.

ready.
    When your mother comes into your room without knocking pretend
to be sleeping. She will say, what happened to the stars. You will feel
translucent. Your insides will be trying to fly away. Your mother will
quietly touch your back and keep her hand there until you start to feel
tired. Concentrate!

down the windows a little. Take it out to the highway. Look. No other
cars are in sight. You are really moving. Forget about your mother. Her
hand is not really there you have to think.)

    "And young man?" I called. He stopped and again stood at attention.

                                                                             Of course, when all was said and done, I'd likely end up downstairs in
    "Sure," he said, digging into his pocket. He handed me the key. "It's
                                                                             the sofa chair, possibly awake but probably not.
your key anyway, sir. You shouldn't have to ask."
    That was the smartest thing I'd heard in months.
    I followed him to the door and watched him as he exited and went
around toward the garage. I felt guilty that he would be a part of this,
but apparently not overly so, as I closed the door and turned the
deadbolt. I returned to the kitchen to make sure the back door was
locked and found that it was. No need to check the basement or any
windows. Annie was big on home security. The only other house key
she'd given out was with Catherine, and she was on vacation. It might
have been at her house but our key to Jerry's and Catherine's was in the
bill drawer. So unless anyone wanted to use a battering ram or start
breaking windows, I was safe for a while.
    After a few minutes, the young man knocked at the door. He politely
called my name. "Mr. Walsh?" he pleaded several times. I started my
journey to the second floor and his voice faded as I ascended the stairs.
When I reached the second floor I glanced over the area just to reacquaint
myself. I heard a car start and assumed it was the young man's.
    Within an hour, Annie returned and pounded on the front door,
yelling something I couldn't make out. I was in bed reading, so I got up
and went over to the staircase to hear what all the fuss was. Maybe she
was irked by having to return so early from her outing.
     She yelled that my actions had proved nothing, and then she did
the obligatory howling-to-God routine. After she concluded that God
was out of the office, she whimpered. I felt a strong inclination to go to
the door but held back. I headed back to my room, reassuring myself
that she would find somewhere to go, maybe her sister's. She had found
refuge without problems every other afternoon.
    Either my hearing failed completely or she just stopped crying all
together, but the whimpering died. Maybe she opened her eyes for a
little while she was wiping them.
                                                                                                                                                     81

ring and go to hell. Decide it would be worth more at the pawn shop
instead. You'll need the money to pay full rent after tomorrow. The
thought of being single again dispirits you, but for now, ride with the
nervous relief of knowing the truth. Ben has been faintly smiling

Julie's teary appeals. He's probably planning his trip. Make a mental

   Questions for group therapy: If rebirth in the vesicapiscis, aka vessel

are not swallowed up in sex, how are they devoured so they might be
reborn? At what price to their psyches?
