                   Now in its 21st year, the Berkeley Fiction Review, in a sense, has
Faculty            come of age. To celebrate this memorable year, we decided not
Stephen Booth      to" take ourselves too seriously. This collection of stories is filled
                   with hilarity and irreverence, in many different, but equally
                   articulate styles. The humor of these stories ranges from the
                   quirky and self-deprecating style of "Why Writers are Lonely"
Publications
                   to the dark satirical tone of "Protection." Collecting these stories
Xavier Hernandez   has taught us that laughter and great literature can congeal in
                   various forms, and that writers today, though faced with a
                   troubled world, still have not lost their sense of humor.

                   the stories in this issue employ humor. Personal growth and
                   internal turmoil over the process of starting over are prevalent
                   themes in such stories as "Crimes Against Nature," "Dinner
                   with the Mercers," and "Tracy." These stories and the others
                   like them in this issue present a noticeably different way of
                   dealing with their problematic worlds than their humorous
                   counterparts. But the stories are not as stylistically opposed as
                   one might think; all of the stories, be they witty or serious,
                   present some sort of tension they negotiate in a unique way. We
                   have found that this issue cleanly synthesizes humor and pain,
                   and it goes down smooth.

                   Five beers later comes the maudlin part: to all our authors, thank
                   you so much for your patience, timeliness, and above all, your
                   wonderful stories. To our staff, we appreciate your dedication
                   and passion for the literary community. Our several years at
                   BFR have been filled with humor, struggle, and personal growth,
                   much like the themes of this issue. It has been our great pleasure
                   to be a part of this publication, and to see ourselves reflected in
                   this issue we give to you, our readers.                (

            illiam T. Whiting had a sinus infection. He guessed he had caught it
            at the post office, where a week ago he had handed a manuscript to
            an Arab-looking woman clerk whom he had not seen before.
Normally he was not one to run to the doctor, but with anthrax on the loose he
figured he'd better have it checked out. Even if it were not a case of chemical
warfare, he had heard stories about virulent sinus infections causing epidural
abscesses, resulting in permanent stupidity or death. Death, okay, but the idea
 of never being able to write another story again caused him great anxiety.
     It usually took a lot to get him to leave the house. He wrote every day,
seven days a week, at least nine hours a day. Ten and eleven were not unusual,
if his fingers were flying. By the end of his working day, there wasn't much to
do but nuke himself some dinner, watch Jay Leno's monologue, think about
what he was going to write the next day, and fall asleep reading.
     Three years earlier his wife, Carolyn, had divorced him and, his interest
in dating being sublimated to his love of fiction, he had found little time or
inclination to get into circulation again. He figured when his libido was ready,
women would still be out there. But even now, three years later, he found little
desire for anything but getting out of bed, brushing his teeth, making a cup of
tea, and cranking up his word processor, from where, the next time he looked
up, it was dark outside once more.
     He did think it would probably do him good to get away from the house once
in a while—apart from trips to the post office—although going to the d,octor was
not quite what he had in mind. Still, the more he thought about that new postal
clerk, the more he was convinced that something was very wrong, sinus-wise.
He seldom got sick, had caught three colds his whole adult life, never suffered
from headaches or other common ailments, and shunned even over-the-counter

              "I swear, I'm a writer."                                                                "If I talk, they'll kill her." She quavered beneath his grip. "They've been

             "I am a writer. I am. I am."                                                             "If you kill me," she pleaded, "my baby dies."
             "You're playing both sides of the street, Billy boy, and that makes it personal."        They were locked together, flesh in flesh, fates ineluctably entwined.

             "It's . . . true," he admitted at last, forehead on knee. "I'm a fraud."                 "He' U be released safely and won't have any recollection of what happened."
            "A bad one."                                                                              "How do I know you're not lying now?"
            "That last book I wrote that went into a second printing . . . I don't know               "You don't," she choked. "It's just a matter of faith."

            "You're wasting precious time."                                                           "Pure faith," she gasped.
            " I . . . tried to fool my wife, too, but she got wise."                                  "What about the dizziness? The buzzing in my ears?"
            "Who's paying your bills?'                                                                "Your imagination," she muttered. "Creative imagination."
            He mumbled something.                                                                     Really?
            "I can't hear you," she said.                                                             It's possible she was just working him, flattering him. But then she whispered",

            She kneeled again.                                                                        She broke .free and ran to the door. "Imbecile!" she cried. "Don't you know,

\ "<        She turned her ear to his whisper. Her eyes were diverted for only an instant,       She bolted out, the door swaying behind her.
       but that was just enough.                                                                      He staggered out of Exam Room 3, his vision still slightly blurred, but strength

            "We die together," he vowed.                                                              "Any questions?" the receptionist asked.
            She tried to wrangle away, but he held tight.                                             He shook his head, shoved the form in his pockety and'left, his nose actually

           A minute later Bev arrived. She was not what he had expected. Bev was an              She glanced around, bit her lower lip, and, sotto voce, said, "They built this

           William instantly decided he could like Bev a lot, especially coming off the         "You're joking, right?"
     grim experience of Dr. Siboney. He had the impression that Bev did^not take life           "What would a quarter-million dollars in 1936 be worth today? Not counting

           Without hesitating, she said, "Oh, not everything's the way it seems."          She looked around. "Someone who's also working here now, would be my guess."

he reached the end of the article he shook his head and read it again in its entirety.
He stood in front of the class, puzzling over the papers in his hands.
      After a very long silence, a student in the back of the room said "Uh,
Professor?"
      Hfuhruhhurr looked up. "Yes?" he said.
                                                                                                     r o o m m a t e

uncertainty: "Oh, fine. Class dismissed." He gestured at the end of the simulated
wood table surface next to his lectem. "Leave your essays here on the table on                        b y G i n g e r        K n o w l t o n

      The students looked at their watches'and at the clock on the wall, their faces
holding expressions of both relief and confusion. No one questioned the professor,
though, or asked for, clarification. They simply gathered their belongings and
quickly shuffled past the table and out the door.

fires

He'd announce, generally in the presence of others, that he'd have a fire
waiting for her when she got home. He understood her desire to be alone, to
hike miles until she couldn't walk clearly, admired her ability to tell him she
didn't want him along for the walking. He'd go home and build fires,
although it wasn't cold or half-cloudy. She'd be sick with the heat, open all
five of her bedroom windows, never escape the heat nonetheless, walk around
in her underwear even though she knew the neighbors were outside in the
dark.

dog

His obsession with her dog was endless. He'd ask to take the animal out, or
not ask. He'd suggest that they have coffee somewhere that the dog could go
too. He'd fawn over the animal, turn it into an it for her when it was clearly a
he, or had been.

meal

They went out for dinner because the kitchen was disgusting and she wanted it
clean, so she left it clean and scattered ugly dishes on the table amongst the
newspapers because she didn't want them on the open shelves, always in view.
So out to dinner. He told the bartender (she'd insisted that they not sit at that
little table in the window) about their dog; she stabbed the vegetables harder,
said ridiculous things about the paintings on the yellow walls, muttered in the
deepest parts of her stiff skull, rolled her eyes when he ordered her salad
without nuts because he's allergic to nuts, not her. If he touched the salad
she'd give it all away, she knew that.

meal, again (wine)

He'd suggested, in front of the bartender, that she have a glass of wine, which
would have been so much like a meal. Red was her natural inclination. He
ordered red wine too, the exact same vintage she'd asked for. She hoped to
meet someone immediately tolerable, the short married bartender perhaps, and
bring him home that evening to have loud sex that would carry through the
hollow plywood door of her room. Erase the question the roommate had
raised of whether they'd be involved had she not answered his ad for a
roommate. He wanted to know if they'd have had meals together, drops of red
wine hanging from his thick lower lip.

     Harry's face flushes. Of course, Steven is right. He just wanted to hear the
words, to be. comforted. He looks away ashamed. The men sit in silence.

fuzzy recognition he feels the noise that startled him, but he cannot place it and
is asleep again before his head comes to a full rest on the pillow. In the bathroom,
Laura shoves the pill bottles back into the medicine cabinet and closes the door.
She listens for„Freddie and, hearing nothing, unscrews the cap on the bottle of
sleeping pills. She shakes four of them into her hand. Laura discovered long
ago that the more you take, the better you sleep. And not only that, but the hour
beforehed is spongy and pleasant. She takes the pills into her room and swallows
them, one at a time, with the glass of water which sits perennially by her bedside.
She smoothes the silk nightgown over her stomach as she lies down; her hands
circle her breasts as her thoughts wander. Once again she is visited by the almost-
memory, something from the past. But by now the.pills are beginning to dance
with the wine, and she relinquishes her thoughts and lets the day scatter likefhe
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that no one wants to play with.
     Downstairs, Steven is patting his pockets and trying to remember what was
in each of them when he arrived. Harry is standing awkwardly, still smarting a
bit from Steven's reproach. Steyen quickly decides that he will/etrieve.the
imaginary losses some other time. He hugs Harry briefly, still disturbed by his
recognition of the significance .of this day. The door closes and Steven watches
Harry's distorted image through the thick glass as he.walks up the stairs. He
feels momentarily lost beneath, the towering house, which looms above him. It
is a sturdy house, just as Laura has always said, but tonight.it seems almost
fragile, ready to crumble at any moment. The moon is full and white, and it
casts a reproachful light on the quiet street as Steven steps off the porch toward
his car. He shjuffles a bit, but stumbles only once. He stofs,,briefly, halfway
down the walk and turns to face the house. In the upstairs window he-sees Harry

he returned to the supermarket and sat on the side curb, but all day she did not
come. The next day was the same, and he sat, endlessly repeating in his head his
favorite lines from the notebook that he had memorized.
      On the third day, she came. She had the baby on her hip and looked hurried.
He watched her ordinary face in wonder. He was able to follow her car on foot
back to her house three blocks away. He noticed that often at night a dim&edroom
light was on until very late, and he presumedshe was filling a new notebook. He
would sometimes sit behind the hedge, whispering towards her bedroom window
her words that he now possessed.
      It took him awhile to work up the courage to knock on her door. Wherthe
did it was raining, and he stood on her doorstep shivering. "Can I help you?"
Her voice was thin, tuneless.
      "Hello, I'm new to the neighborhood, and I'm knocking on people's doors
ib see if they have any side jobs needing to be done." It was his rehearsed speech.
"Lean do a lot of different things," he added hopefully. The woman studied his
eager face. "Sure," she said, though she did not know why. She couldn't afford
to pay anyone. Nevertheless, she led him into the backyard in the rain, to a little
run-down tool shed.
       "This needs to be cleaned out," she said. "It's full of cobwebs and trash from
the last people." She looked at him and her mouth dented her cheeks in what
may have been a smile. He was to return the next day to begin.
      The boy worked diligently and nearly finished the work in-one day. He knew
that she would be at work all the next day when he returned. The next morning
in the shed he cut bits of colored paper and used magic markers as he hadn't
since he was a little boy. He taped and glued and hung paper until the walls and
ceiling were covered. In the middle1 of the room, propped on a chair, was the
returned notebook.
      When the woman returned from work, he called her politely to the shed.
When he opened the door, she gasped. Your love decorated me, it said across the

 invisibility cloak or his beast-claws spell. Every day of middle school I was afraid
 of getting picked on by other kids and afraid of getting called on by teachers. I
 don't know if I can describe the way it felt when I grew.to six feet tall my freshman
year of high school, when I donned black t-shirts and metalhead garb and seized
 the double-edged type of power thatxomes from frightening other people. After
 one year of high'school—after one week of high school—it was obvious that I
would never be cool. But when I first wore a leather coat to school, October of
sophomore year, and I walked-into the student lounge with my friends and felt the
jocks and girls staring at me with just the faintest worry that I might flip out .on
them, and it felt like: you value these things, so I value these other things. You
wear white, my friends and I wear black. I would go across the street fronuthe
school with my outsider friends and we' d all stand in a tight circle, our shoulders
almost touching, smoking cigarettes and talking about how*dumb and lame all the
normal kids were. We don't want to be you: we're the opposite of you.
      So, it's a coat. I know it is just a coat. Tell me you never felt a piece of your
 identity tied up with a piece of clothing. You never put on a new sweater and felt
like people looked at you differently. Tell me that confidence isn't in some way a
magical quality. My life, like yours, isfilledwith small rituals and daily superstitions.
I wore my leather coat when I called irfto my temp agency and told, them that I
would not be going to work for GlobalRe anymore. I wore my leather coat when I
put my apartment in boxes, when I called Mark and told him that Tennaguar was
becoming a contemplative, pursuing a more solitary and mystical form of spiritual
 pursuit, and that his adventuring days—at least in this campaign, at least with
these players, as I did riot tell Mark—were over.
      Anna and I have discussedjour plans atlength and we want to be sensible
about this: right now we know one another intangibly, as spirits, and it will take
time for us to'become accustomed to each other's bodies. We will continue to
move slowly, incrementally, carefully, but we can only do this if we live in the same
city. Secretly I am hoping that things move very fast, as they often do when you
have confidence in what you're„doing.

           facing the following obstacles; he is scornful, envious, and untalented.
            I should warn you ahead of time that this story has a lot of pathos. Be
            prepared to think thoughts like, 'Hey, he's an all right guy. Why can't
           he catch a break? Why is there so much pathos in this story?' While, at
           times, this story appears too light, rest assured that it is permeated by a
           subtle sense of longing and regret Unfortunately, you are probably too
                                   stupid to understand it.

           t was Manny's favorite line in world literature and he was determined
           to turn it into an epigraph. He had had favorite lines before, but none
           could match this. The very idea of night being hung from the stars
made him grit his teeth with awe and envy. Then there was that word heaventree.
It sounded so sweet and natural-rolling off the tongue that he could hardly believe
people tried describing the star's in different ways. (Although, sometimes Manny
thought heavenorchard was more appropriate on account of there being so many
of them). There was also the way the sentence sounded so smooth; all the H's
flowing together. There was a certain dignity to H's that Manny respected, even
when they were silent.
     Once, before he'd fallen deeply and jealously in love, Manny thought that
sentence was the only thing he cared about as much as himself. Every word had
the proper weight and no amount of criticism could destroy it. The only problem
with the sentence is that it didn't work as an epigraph to Manny's novel.
     He scribbled furiously—trying to make his characters more humid or
heavenly—but nothing seemed right. He knew the basic plot details, but it still
lacked the certain je ne sais quois1 needed to make it a masterpiece. It revolved
around the adventures of Jesse Carpenter, *a thirty-three year old fisherman and
societal outcast. Jesse has several interior monologues about the importance of
