                                                   T h i s past year the staff of t h e Berkeley Fiction     Review
                                               embraced the dual roles of reader and writer, critic and advo-
                                               cate, servant and judge of short fiction. M u c h like the writer
                                               who scribbled in stolen hours , we p e e p e d at manuscript s
                                               between classes and during lectures. Just as our writers labored
                                               over the turn of a phrase, we debated in depth the craft of a
                                               piece or the honesty of its characters. And finally, with the same
                                               faith in literature that compels a writer to enclose a story, seal an
                                               envelope and lick a stamp, we have refined, bound, and pack-
                                               aged, in a frenzy of editing and type and art, a book.
                                                   Editorial staffs run the second leg of a literary relay race,
                                               from an unblemished manuscript to the final, perfectly bound
                                               product. T h e fact that we carry someone else's work across the
finish line does, not make the victory any less sweet. Whereas
writers have vision, we have a conviction in the importance of
the vision we witness. Our stories provide the crucial freedom to
peer, like the eyes of our cover, into the chaotic beauty of
another imagination.
    As a journal, the Berkeley Fiction Review has nurtured this
conviction through fifteen issues. It has consistently provided a
forum for emerging writers and student staffs alike to flex their
creative strength. However, we have changed the scope of the
project with this issue. Our objective is not just to maintain a
university publication, but to establish, with a quality book and
our first ISSN, a national journal.
    In the face of severe budgetary restraints on education in
general and the creative arts in particular, this is a bold position.
As established university publications in recent years have faded
to thinner and thinner volumes, we challenge what we see as a
disturbing trend across the country.
    We invite our readers, as they travel through the images,                                     L a u r e n Alwan
absurdities, and humor of our stories, to join us in this sense of
purpose.

    "Best we can do is seventy-five bucks on the trade-in."

she took a seat at the table. She said it with such practiced angst
I didn't dare correct her. I just listened while she spoke of cards
and karma, about the aces you'll be dealt if you're very, very
kind.

B.S. Ptitman
   A hack poet attempts to revive his shattered ego in bed
with a teenage runaway. The road to River City, an
irredeemable place in the heart, is circumscribed by loss
and an uneasy freedom. A dark red ocean calmly rises
and falls like the brain waves of the comatose around an
island populated by bleeding mannequins.
   The Berkeley Fiction Review, funded by the Associated
Students of the University of California, Berkeley,
publishes inventive work by emerging writers who
represent the fragmented voices of contemporary life.
