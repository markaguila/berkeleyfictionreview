                                  Here at the Berkeley Fiction Review we deal in language.
      Faculty
                         From the intensely heated debates waged weekly by our staff to the
    Stephen Booth        monotonous process of revision, correspondence and maintenance that
                         keeps our publication afloat, language ties our work together. We are
                         blessed to contribute to the tradition of the Berkeley Fiction Review; a
   Publications          tradition of passionate commitment to literature.

                                  Unfortunately, this year got off to a shaky start and we quickly
                         learned the meaning of the saying "when it rains, it pours." What began
      Alumna             as a straightforward editorial-process turned into a deluge of past
                         mismanagement and broken communication. We want to thank all the
Sarah McClure Haufrect
                         writers and contributors who kept their patience while we waded through
                         seemingly endless amounts of backed-up work.

                                  Our staff members this year were particularly discerning and
                         approached all the stories we received with open minds and critical eyes.
                         We are proud of the fine staff that worked tirelessly reading and
                         selecting stories and we are proud of the fantastically talented writers
                         who make this process worthwhile,

                                  As a result, we are proud to present you with thirteen excellent
                         stories that span the spheres of joy, sorrow and even the wonderfully
                         absurd through their creativity and originality. They are the result of the
                         storms we have weathered, and we hope that they in turn provide you
                         shelter from the various rains life can bring, and continue to do so as you
                         return to read them again and again.

                                The monk grins and swallows beer. The stone trembles. The Taoist,

                      the glass to the tap and lets the liquid slide in.

takes his hand and puts it on her stomach, he will tell her what he has to tell her. He
will watch her face change. He will feel the slackening of her body.

                JL      days ago and gave to me. I named him Chuckles, 'cause he's a
     woodchuck and his fur is so soft it tickles my fingers. But Chuckles hasn't sucked
     any of the milk from my dropper, and he has diarrhea. Everywhere.
                "No!" I cry, "I can't"
                "It's the right thing to do," he says.
                "But how?" I ask.
                "Just like a sufferin' runt pig," he says. "You take it by the back legs and
     snap your wrist fast. Breaks its neck. They don't feel it, and then they're at peace.
     It aint right to let a wee one suffer," he says quietly. " It aint right."
                Chuckles' limp body pumps each breath hard in my hand. His fur is wet
     with my tears. I hand him to Farmer Gaffney.
                "I can't," I say. "You do it." And I run.
                Later we bury Chuckles in a shoebox in the garden next to Lucky Houdini,
     my goldfish, and Elfie, our mouse. We put on our black clothes and line-up under
     the big Maple and sing the sad songs for Chuckles. Farmer Gaffney sings 'Mazing

     British pounds later he still hadn't landed a second. So finally the fair guy just let

          So we took Ruby, her red-eyed husband, out of the cage. I think Mink the
cat got him. He disappeared anyway, so he didn't get a shoebox. Then Elfie had
two more litters, one right after the other, all by herself.
          "Yup," Farmer Gaffney said, "mice store sperm."
          "What's sperm?" I asked.
          "baby seed."
          "Oh."
          Elfie seemed to store memory of Ruby too, 'cause she kept right on eating
her babies. My little sister started searching everyday day for new pink pieces of
baby mice. She left the top off the cage and Mink got in. Mom caught Mink in the
act. Not soon enough to save Elfie, but soon enough to have something to put in
a shoebox. So we decorated a new one, put£n,our black clothes, lined-up under
the big Maple and sang the sad songs for Elfie. Farmer Gaffney missed Elfie's
funeral, he was away selling his big old pig. Mom-said we couldn't wait, we'd
better get Elfie in the ground. So I sang 'Mazing Grace a little extra loud for Farmer
Gaffney, and later he said he could hear me clear across the county.

      D            r. Varian read over his dictation once more. It was impeccable. The
                   grammar, the punctuation, down to the spelling of idiosyncratic surgical
                   terms like "the Mattox maneuver" or "Denonvilliers' fascia" were perfect.
     "Allis clamps"- was typed correctly instead of "Alice clamps." The "B" in "DeBakey
     forceps" was appropriately capitalized. This must be hers. There was no doubt.
               Dr. Varian always had a special fondness for precision. Though he realized
     it was a tall order to hold most people to, he frequently emphasized the importance
     of precision to his residents in the operating room. "Don't barbeque that whole
     side," he would snap as his nervous resident holding the Bovie cautery tried to
     suppress his intention tremor. "Find'the one bleeder and stop it."
               He demanded precision from many areas of his life. He himself was
     unfailingly punctual to morning rounds. For residents working on his service, he
     expected them to adhere to the dictum: if you're five minutes early, you are ten
     minutes too late. If someone were to present a patient to him, he wanted to know
     the exact value of the white blood cell count, not simply that it was elevated. If a
     resident was to tell him that a patientwas'going into renal failure, he expected a
     recitation of the patient's creatinine for the last five days. But above all, Dr. Varian
     demanded precision in the operating room. He believed that every patient deserved
     the perfect operation and the perfect operation was based on precision, from first
     incision to last stitch. He had practiced long enough to know that at times
     complications happen despite all efforts. But that was even more reason to hold
     himself and those he worked with to the highest standards. This meant he expected
     his scrub nurse to hand him the exact instrument he wanted when he wanted it. He
     expected his medical students to cut the suture 3mm from the knot when he told

pass before she became used to the obscurity of the room. On shelves, inside large
laboratory vessels, in some kind of smelly preserving liquid, women's heads floated.
They were not whole heads, but half-heads, with a single wide-open eye, which
even alone and lifeless hadn't lost the power to question when, why, and how had
the heads stopped being whole. In other flasks, human fetuses also floated in
liquid.
         At that moment a hand touched her shoulder, and while suppressing a
scream, she heard the director's voice telling her, "This was my father's lab."
         There was no animosity in his voice, and not even surprise at finding her
there. With a little laugh, as if laughing against his will, he pointed to the flasks
containing fetuses, and added, "And if it weren't for your mother, you would be
there."
         As she turned to look at him, she noticed a jeer that distorted his mouth,
and the harsh glance of one who never suffers or forgives. A need to run and
escape took the place of any other thought or reasoning. This inexplicable panic
would repeat itself throughout her life, each time she met that assured glance in
other people—as if in the fabric's uniformity of mental health, she had learned to
discern the invisible yet dangerous stain. There was something in that man's
expression she would never forget: a dimness that the left eyelid, closing itself
involuntarily, underlined constantly, which was a satisfaction, a pride of being
who he was, that bordered on insanity.

 I      n January, the wind from the sea would get so strong that it could shut down
        the seaside town for days at a time. It usually came at night and would travel
        up the South Lanes, narrow shopping streets that were converted from
fishermen's alleys, sweeping up everything in its path; it made rubbish dance
along the pavement, bolted down chairs and tables rattle like shackled prisoners,

                   Sara propped open the front door.
                   "Oh," Megalinda said. She looked at the ribbon in her hand and then at

        I'll go with her. I think she'd prefer to walk back with a friend."

         Your drill sergeant, seemingly, begins to glare.                                         It's a familiar voice...

         "Yes, colonel."
         "I know who he is," your drill sergeant assures them.
         Turning to face the four of them fully, you dare to stand alone in the gas
and stare back up at them.
         "I hope you know who he is, sergeant," the colonel says. "I've never
seen anything like this in twenty years in the Army. That's a good soldier."
         "Yes, sir," a cadre officer agrees. "A damn good soldier."
         "I want that trainee's name, sergeant," the colonel says. "I think, maybe,
be belongs in Officers Candidate School."
         For a long time, your drill sergeant doesn't reply. But then, finally, he
reluctantly speaks. "Yes, colonel," he's forced to say. "I'll get you his name."
         Having heard that, having taken it all in, you gladly turn and disappear
back into the CS gas to go through the course a third and final time. This time

his perception of your lack of cooperation and his inability to make you tell him
what he's sure you know. Back toward the rear wall of the-interrogation room he
stomps, another time, fists clenched tightly in anger and doberman hackles in
fierceness raised. He spins to face and confront you.

                Ivan Smith has recently returned to New York, his dissertation having
      proved unfeasible, to find many of his friends no longer in town. He would
      have stayed in North Carolina, so goes his version of the story, if it had not
      been for Leslie's cajoling.
                On the evening of his twenty-eighth birthday, Ivan has quite a bit to
      drink. The soiree, as Leslie has named it, takes place at the home of friends of
      hers with whom he is not entirely comfortable.
                Around eleven o'clock, after finishing the last of several bottles of
      burgundy, he suggests they better get going.
                "It's always a pleasure to spend time with Leslie's friends," he says on
      the way out the door, trying not to sound sarcastic.
                The occasion of his birthday warrants the choice of a taxi over the long
      subway ride back to Queens, but when it gets intractably stuck on the ramp
      leading up to the bridge, he harrumphs emphatically.
                "Yes, you're right," says Leslie, "the train would have been faster."
                After ten minutes of minimal progress, a peculiar sensation begins in
      the front of his foot opposite from the arch, similar to the sort of restlessness he

sad discus eyes.
