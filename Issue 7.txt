    A mother can wear her own self well into the ground working
to give her child a chance at a life; but she can't ever kill herself
outright. That would be just plain unmotherly.
    What a mother can do is just so many things. She can teach a
son to earn his keep. She can teach a daughter nice and young to
cook and scrub floors and mend her own clothing and later to sew
enough for others. A mother can moan right out.loud about the
wreck of her own life and the pointlessness of it when nothing gets     I I!
better and nobody notices a damn thing she does anyway. A moth-
er can swat a backside with a tight rolled newspaper or just any
old thing; and a slap upside the head never in her life could make
a stupid child any stupider than they were d a m n well intent to
become. And, a mother can rest just as soundlessly as possible, be-
cause it's best for her if nobody knew she ever did such a thing.
     And it is always easy for a mother to kiss and h u g her chil-
dren, because she loves each and every dirty-faced one of them.
She'd got it in her fool head to love their no good daddies once too
though. She knows the foolishness of that sort of love though, and
is best to put it aside. A square meal and a roof over his head tells
a child he is loved much more sensibly than a hundred warm hugs
in a shelterless cold ever could. A mother knows just what she
needs to know and stays healthy by dreaming of outliving her off-
spring. Meanness keeps her healthy in hard times. She has to fig-
ure if she can't live well then she's sure as hell going to live her-
self one long old time instead.

      press into me so hard it seemed like she wanted inside. "I'd take        felt the way I did when I climbed the big tree in the woods with

      cried every time just the same. Elaine was sensitive like mother.        let the devil burn your baby sister?"
            Mother didn't come out of her room for bedtime stories any-            I could feel the tears sliding down my face. "I wouldn't do a
        more. She hardly came out at all, except to go to the bathroom.        thing cause there's no such thing as the devil or God, and when we

        Lipton tea with lots of sugar and sat on her bed and tried to tell
        her how Whiskey eyes was hurting me differently now, not just
        with the belt like he used to. But she looked at me funny like she
        didn't know me, and all she ever said was the tea is delicious, just
        how I like it, and take care of the babies.
           "Amanda!" It was my turn. "If the devil gave you the choice
      of drinking blood or taking the mark, would would you do?" The
      first question was always easy. "I'd drink it." "You probably al-

      over a fire and he said he'd drop heir in if you didn't take it?" The

      to me. I clenched my teeth, thinking "I hate you Whiskey eyes. I
      wish the devil would cut off your head and drink the blood." He
      always saved toe for last. It was a contest between us. He would
      put the kids or mother in the hands of the devil, and I always
      had to save them without letting the devil tattoo those numbers
      on my forehead. I liked saving them, feeling like a hero, listening

      my way out of it with the devil, and Whiskey eyes knew every
