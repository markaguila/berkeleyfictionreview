FACULTY
                          This year the Berkeley Fiction Review celebrated its 20th year of
                          existence. All of us on staff feel the full value of that number,
                          the experience that has been gained, the pitfalls and the heights
                          we have broken out of and risen to; 20 is also the average age of

                          and we can only hope that the tradition will carry on.

                          This year's selections come from a very diverse group of
                          writers, who hail from cities as far away as Vancouver, and as

                          work of unification. The Berkeley Fiction Review takes great
                          pride in bringing together this diverse collection of stories for
                          everyone to enjoy and to share.

                   Jan turns from the sunny window, blinks, shakes the
                daydreaming trance from her head. The kitchen is stifling with
                afternoon air. Cutting off the water, she dries her hands on a
dish towel. A fly moves sluggishly past, half-dead from the heat, unconcerned
about flyswatters. Jan kneels so they're face to face. She loves seeing Hank
up close like thisâ€”it gives her chills to think that someday he'll be her height,
someday she'll have to look up into his face. His blond hair is getting long,
curling out of control. A man thought he was a girl last week in the grocery
store. Perhaps she should cut it, she thinks, but she's afraid of screwing it
up. She hates going to the barbershop: the thick men with cologne-and-
cigarette-scented breath, fat fingers holding scissors too close to his neck,
the long wait while she bites her nails, spits the slivers. She puts her fingers
through his curls, his serious expression making her smile.
     "What's it doing, buddy?"
     "It just keeps jumping." His eyes move slowly downward as if he's
afraid to look. The fly buzzes. He hiccups. "That was it. Did you hear it?"
     "Yeah. You've got the hiccups."
     "Will it go away?"
     "Sure. Try holding your breath."
     He puffs his cheeks, places his fists against his neck as if to hold the air
back. The clock on the wall hums and the second hand races around its
white face. Should a little boy hold his breath this long? Jan looks at the
clock, but of course, she never started timing so its speeding second hand
means nothing. Hank hiccups and giggles, placing a hand on his heart as if
about to pledge allegiance. "Just a second," Jan says, filling a glass with tap
water, tasting itâ€”room temperature, slightly metallic. "Here. Drink this fast."
He does, but after just a few swallows, his chest jerks, and his eyes widen.
She smiles, but has to admit she feels a bit uneasy. She knows it's nothing.
Still, she wants to fix it. "Hey, buddy, try to drink upside down." He hesitates,
squints and bites his lip. She can see the picture in his mind: balanced on his
head, drinking a glass of water somehow unaffected by gravity. "Like this,"

     I nod.
     Hoppy kneels beside Max, but his attention is fixed on the approaching
policeman. He leans into Max, whispers, "The cops will screw you if they
find drugs in your car. If you have any, tell me where they are and I'll remove
them."
     "Tell him, Max," I blurt out.
     Max turns his head toward my familiar voice, shrieks in pain.
     "Don't move," Hoppy says. "Wink once if your car is clean."
     Apparently Max does. "Come on," Hoppy says. "We've got a scoop and
scoot."
     I watch them load Max into the back of the ambulance as if they're doing
no more than shoving a pizza into an oven. Hoppy follows him in. Nick again
turns on the siren, rolls down the window, spits. "I'm sorry about your friend,"
he says.
     "Payday!" Hoppy says. "I knew it!" An orange plastic vial flies into the
front cabin. Nick picks it up, examines it, drops it suddenly. "Christ on a
crutch," he says and lets go of the steering wheel long enough to wipe his
hands on his pants legs. I pick up the vial, hopeful, and begin to unscrew the
safety cap.
     "I wouldn't do that," Nick says.
     "Why not?"
     "AZT." He looks at me. "Friend of yours, huh?"
     "We're on the same crew."
     "I'll bet you are," Nick says.
     I drop the vial. I wonder what kind of buzz AZT provides, then realize that
I'm doing it too, scrubbing my hands against my thighs. I know it's Max, but
I can't stop.

     I'm sitting in my living room with the lights out so Nick and Hoppy won't
drop by. I've taken two blistering showers and washed my hands with Clorox.
I'm sitting in my Lazy-Boy, stuck in the adhesion of my own sweat. My last
beer lies empty at my feet. Max's vial sits by the door sealed inside three Zip-
loc baggies.
     Hoppy said Max's accident wasn't life-threatening. So after I get some
sleep, and lunch, I'll probably go see him. I'll bring him a copy of Playgirl just
for grins, find out what he wants to do with his meds. If he's alert, I'll ask him
where he shops, maybe get the name of that mall store. I'll act like nothing has

nubs of flesh, and the medal he'd strung with yarn and construction paper
fell with the thunder of his last carved letter.

                 ust yesterday she sat on the dock with her feet in the water,
                 her skirt hiked to her knees, mumbling all muddled-like to the
                 skittish fish, reaching for them with her toes. I was trying to
                 get by, slip my new kayak into the water and paddle off before
she noticed. But at the last minute she turned around and lucidly asked me for
her sewing basket, like she hadn't been talking crazy to the fish, like she knew
I was there the whole time, waiting until I thought I was in the clear.
     She sat on the dock and said, "I'm going to stitch the waves of this sea
right into a blanket for you. Would you like that Benny? They'll ride up your
bed and wash over you in the night." Drown you, is what she meant. Drown
you when your father's safe in the city during the week and you're stuck out
here with me.

     Now I fish for the milk buried in the fridge and hope she doesn't call
down the stairs. I'm pretty sure she's aiming to weave some spell, to make all
those mad shadows of hers spill onto the ground in front of my feet, so I can't
leave. I better get out the door quickly, so I forget the milk and grab a couple
pieces of raisin bread instead.
     This morning before she wakes up, I take the kayak to work across the
lake. Maybe tonight I'll hang out in town with some of the guys or paddle
over to Ashley Cooper's until the old lady's passed out. No boats have been
out on the water yet this morning and each stroke is like a sharp blade cutting
through glass. It looks damn cool, those little swirling eddies swinging behind
me.
     I can just make out the marina on the other side of Sajiwaki and it's
looking pretty quiet this morning. Definitely the best part of my job there is
diving down to retrieve sunken keys and sunglasses, jewelry and wallets for
stupid tourists. The greater their loss the bigger my tip and I've learned I can
increase this gratitude by spending at least twenty minutes going through the
algae and rocks before surfacing, making them worry just long enough to pay
me what I'm worth. Harry finally sold me his old dive equipment at a decent
price and I get all the retrieval business now.

My mother was a stunning woman once. In old pictures I can see how long
eyelashes and angular bones hid her madness well. She wore dresses that
cinched her waist and flattered her bust. Is it sick of me to notice?
      To calm herself when the troubles started, she made blankets and pillows
all the time, tablecloths too, crazy colours. Once back at the house in Toronto,
she buried me in a stack of them. I laughed until I couldn't breath any more                        M I L T O N ,       K E A T S ,      A   N   D      M   Y

                                                                                         animalistic, so impersonal. I wonder if Luna's had other kinds
                                                                         of sex with other guys or if it's just me that makes her not want eye contact.
                                                                         Jeezus, I sound like a woman.
                                                                              So we finish and I pull out, resting my hand slightly on the curve of her
                                                                         ass before flipping over and lying next to her.
                                                                              "Gil?" she asks, leaning over to pet my eyebrow. Shit like this confuses
                                                                         me. You'll pet my eyebrow but you won't have sex the normal way?

                                                                              "Why?"
                                                                              "You seem... I don't know. You just seem different." She moves her hand
                                                                         away from my face and sets it next to her. I can smell the faded scent of her
                                                                         shampoo; vanilla and almonds. Luna is into all that smelly, girly stuff. She

                                                                              "Can we go to Angelo's?" 1 ask. The line's usually long, especially on

They say no one could have saved her but you know that's a lie.

That's her doing the jitterbug. That's her singing Patsy Cline. That's her riding   1   ***   ^Hlfrfl*"1
on the back of her brother's Harley. That's her throwing a wine bottle at the
bedroom mirror. That's her laughing. That's her really laughing. That's her
breaking down in the bathroom of an International House of Pancakes. That's
her in the Magic Kingdom. That's her at the Stoned Pony. That's her going
back home to Missouri for a while to try to get better. That's her drinking hot
cocoa with marshmallows. That's her jumping puddles. That's her chasing
boys around the playground. That's her hiding under her bed. That's her in the
sunglasses she stole from Wal-Mart. That's her in her favorite dress. That's
her wrapped in the blanket I gave her the year before she died.

How much longer can I live this way?

One day you let her go. You just give up, give in. Everyone's right and you're
wrong and it's time you face this because your love isn't enough to believe in
anymore. Perhaps it was never love at all. You think about this and then you
realize that they've won.

It begins like this. You look into her eyes and they're so deep you almost fall
in, so rich they hold everything. You can't look away. You want to look into
her eyes forever. But then something happens, and they change. The light
starts to disappear and they become cold and empty, and it seems as if she
almost isn't there anymore. So you wait. You wait for her to come back. You
hope that she'll just come back.

That's her haunting me like a ghost.
