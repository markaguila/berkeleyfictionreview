                                For nearly twenty years, the Berkeley Fiction Review has
                           been publishing short fiction by new and emerging writers. In
F A C U L T Y
                           that time, our readership has grown, in part due to an intense
                           focus on publicity and distribution. The increasing number of

                           short story submissions we receive each year is reflective of these
                           efforts. The publication itself has evolved into its current format,
                           which features color cover art, full-page line art, and 165 pages
P U B L I C A T I O N S
                           of contemporary fiction. In this issue, we are pleased to spotlight
                           four photographs depicting Bay Area scenes as part of our interior
Xavier H e r n a n d e z   art. Issue #20 also includes the winners of our Fourth Annual
                           Sudden Fiction Contest as well as sixteen full-length stories.

                                Though not intentionally, we sometimes select a number
                           of stories that share a certain theme, perspective, or topic. In
                           the case of this issue, we have noticed several such sets of

                           innovative storytelling techniques. As with the rest of the stories
                           in Issue #20, the styles and genres of these pieces complement

                           each other and enhance the variety of this collection.

                  I scoop and spit out, scoop and spit out. Three at a time,
                  four at a time, five, six, seven, all eight. The pink rubber
    ball smudges the air going up and wipes its own trace away going down.
    Recess will be over and I will be scrubbing my hands in the bathroom
    sink before I notice the sting of scrapes from the rough sidewalk. I
    have become so fast at this game that Candice has started to act like it's
    okay for the other girls to know that we're friends. She talks to me out
    loud now in the classroom, instead of only in secret notes, and she's
    given me a woven bracelet of silky green and orange thread. Even Mean
    Mirella Nolan holds her tongue now. She has stopped calling me
    Brownie or Dothead, although she still never talks directly to me and
    never uses my name. But when I'm winning this game everyone forgets
    that I was the only fifth-grader not to receive a Presidential Fitness
    Certificate because I couldn't do a single chin-up and it took me fifteen
    minutes to run four times around the track. And the best thing is that I
    don't have to look at any of them, the strong popular girls who can run
    a mile in six minutes and do fifty sit-ups in a row. I only look down at
    the blue and green and red jacks, which are metal but light as feathers,
    and don't make me nervous like softballs or Frisbees.
        For once the girls are watching me instead of me always watching
    them.
        Far off I can hear them shushing each other so they don't break my
    concentration.

     That night I sneak a look at my mother before entering her tiny
home office behind the TV room. I peek through the slatted double-

eyes fierce and severe. Knotted bark melted into uneasy grins. Small
animals stopped in their tracks, stood their full height and moreâ€”so
much more. Odd, jagged shadows rose up from the still damp earth,
joined one-dimensional hands and wavered in front of Henrietta like a
string of paper dolls.
     "I think I need to go home now," Henrietta said, but her words fell
 heavy into the damp undergrowth.
     "This is home," her headache said, now so very real. "There's
something we must tell you."
     The shadows and trees and small animals came to her in turn; each
apparition took her hand, whispered the same short message in her
ear: "Welcome to the body," they said. "Welcome to the pain." When
the silhouettes took her hand, when they placed a hand on her chilled
 shoulder, Henrietta's imagination filled with pictures of places she'd
 never been: empty alleys, crack-plastered rooms that smelled of urine
 and sweat, cold spaces where she felt herself trapped by the strong
 arms of faceless men. Sounds and smells as real and unforgiving as the
 cold, damp ground that burned her feet.
      Henrietta didn't have the words for it then, but she knew what she
 saw was called future: cold and gray and gloomy as the woods. And in
 the future lay the sad, cold truths: Baba Yaga boils children and Hansel
 and Gretel die. And the handsome prince turns away because he's afraid,
 repulsed by cold, white lips.
      As suddenly as the parade began, it ended: images, shadows,
 creatures settled back into the dew from which they had arisen.
 Henrietta's headache stood behind her, his hand firm and solid on her
 shoulder. Somewhere in the distance, she heard the crunch of gravel
 beneath the wheels of her father's truck, and she knew that soonâ€”too
 soonâ€”she would be all alone.
                                                                                                                                                   77

oval pie and glaze it with egg wash.
    When I first came here I couldn't crack an egg, couldn't bear to cut
open a melon. Now I slice and mash and chop. I know an egg is just an
egg, a melon just a melon.
    But there are other things I know, things a mother should never
know. A mother should never see the cracked skull of her child, her
hands should never touch her daughter's brain.
    My husband says I should forget.
     How can I forget?
    As a child, I dug domed forts in banks of snow. But I never shaped
my tunnel to the road; my igloo entrance always faced the field. Why
did my daughter come crawling out when I was backing, when the
drive was slick with ice? Why then? When the car might slide, skid,
thump.

     "Hey," said the voice, with a notably accusatory air, "are you some
kind of animal rights nut, or something? We didn't kill them you know."
     "No," I replied, "no, I was just curious."
     "Yeah, so you snuck onto the airport grounds at midnight dressed

     I got up, terrified, and began to run back toward the fence. The
Man Who Cuts The Grass put his tractor into gear, turned up his stereo,
and continued to cut the grass.
     I hadn't seen his face.

     Well, the mystery had been solved, however incomplete the solution
turned out to be. All the same, I found it surprisingly difficult to return
to a normal state. I finally had the good idea of purchasing two American-
self-help motivational videos via the Internet. One can hardly help but
be inspired to greater productivity by American self-help motivational
videos, particularly ones from such noted personal-productivity gurus
as these. Thanks to them, I was able to re-center my life according to
the essentials. After a couple of weeks I apologized to M. de Charenton
and I told Francpis-Xavier that I had taken his advice and learned to
subordinate my penis to my brain. I also threw out my rabbit books.
Aside from a certain lingering predilection for spy movies I have thus
been able to terminate this strange interlude with a minimum of scars.
     I must confess, however, that sometimes (although never while at
work, of course) I do wonder what drove the rabbits to do what they
did. Was it some kind of hopeless counter-attack? Was it a simple bid
for attention? Or were the rabbits, by betraying the grass for the

     Grandma came into the room then. Her wrinkled eyes were red                 at the picnic table eating french fries. That's exactly what I'd thought
